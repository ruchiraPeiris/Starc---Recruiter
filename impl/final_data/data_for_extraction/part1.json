The project was agile, hence constant communication with Yasas throughout the project from planning to daily scrums.\n \n Yasas is a very talented and hard working young man with a lot of potential. Yasas is very innovative and always looking for new solutions and fresh ideas that can advance his knowledge to exceed expectations and goals. He is passionate about his work and always seems to have great awareness of new creative strategies and technology.\n \n Yasas is dedicated, enthusiastic, intelligent, and responsible.\n \n The project was a complicated and complexed new technology initiative that required a lot of attention / effort, learning and team work. Yasas's dedication & contribution to this initiative set us up well to make the project a success.\n \n Edmund Sanjeev\n Systems Analyst/ Product Owner \n Icon Global\n Edmund.sanjeev@iconglobal.com.au\\nYasas is a highly-motivated, focused and talented individual who always looking for new challenges. We worked together in 99X Technology on a project which delivered single page web application as a modernization of a legacy healthcare management system. Yasas did a wonderful job in this project by automating the delivery chain using cloud infrastructure of AWS with a modern toolchain and best practices. This greatly increased developer productivity and shortened the development cycle.Ability to taking the ownership of what he get assigned is the rare quality I see in Yasas. Moreover, he got great analytical, programming and presentation skills. I undoubtedly recommend him for any future endeavor which these qualities matter.\nYasas was an excellent intern I worked with very recently. He is magically super fast in grabbing knowledge and being a master of it. He is extremely good at explaining what he knows to the other team members very clearly. He is ultra dependable and you don't need to have any worries about the tasks you give to him. His attitude towards work is extremely great. He is always result driven. I highly recommend him for any project. \nI have had the pleasure of working with Yasas in my capacity as a volunteer and the Programme Director of SL2College. Yasas initially joined SL2College as a Speaker at SL Inspire School Seminars. Given his impressive work ethic and dedication to the team, I asked him to take up the position of Assistant Programme Manager in the seminar team, where he was responsible for organising and coordinating the ground level activities of numerous seminars. One of the many challenges when working with volunteers is the lack of accountability. Yasas is one of the few individuals with whom this is not an issue. When he takes on a responsibility we have complete faith that he would deliver. Furthermore, he is a great public speaker and I have personally witnessed him inspiring hundreds of young school students to pursue higher education."}

Upon registration, a one-time sentiment analysis of posted “check-ins” of the user will be conducted which derives an explicit rating for each location visited by the user, to identify the user’s travel preferences. \n\nBased on the identified preferences, unvisited locations in any city in Sri Lanka can be rated by a state-of-the-art recommender implementing a user-based collaborating filtering technique. The uniqueness of the solution rests in the use of social media data available on Facebook to identify user preferences and the logic of the recommendation system which can robustly handle the cold start problems. \n\n“TravelSL” is extremely user-friendly as it then designs an optimum route covering top recommended locations based on the traveling mode, distance, predicted rating and existing reservations for each location made visible to the user on Google Maps.\n\nTechnologies Used: Python 3.x, Mongo DB, Android StudioEmbla Sphere - HR Portal\nMar 2016 – Aug 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is implemented as an internal project of the Embla Software Innovation Pvt Ltd. This is an HR Management system which basically helps to record the information of employees and allowing to see their average working hours, late attendance, remaining and taken leaves and missed punch records. Apart from that, this system facilitates the employees to apply leaves based on their allocations. \n\nTechnologies used: Angular 1.x, Web API2, SQL Server Management Studio, Repository Design Pattern, Unit of work"

The website will enhance and help to promote Mrs. Erandi’s business by providing a\nway to publish her good work and get more customers through the website.Web based system for audio monitoring\nJan 2014\n\nProject descriptionThe purpose of the project is to assist the relevant authorities to enforce the Intellectual Property Act of Sri Lanka. The system would monitor all the radio stations in Sri Lanka and provide a report consisting of the songs played by the radio station, which would allow OSCA ( Outstanding Song Creators' Association - The Client ) to send the radio stations invoices and charge them for the songs played thereby provide the flow of royalties to the copyright holders of the songs. We were provided with the song identification algorithm and we developed a web based solution connecting it to our system which facilitates storing all the details and viewing reports at the end of a certain period of time."

Therefore, in this dissertation, our aim was to propose a system which facilitate the communication between normal and deaf people. Same problem has been addressed by using different techniques in different approaches, but they are for facilitating languages other than Sinhala language. To implement our proposed system, leap motion controller, image processing techniques, NLP module, Weka tool and Festival framework has been selected as technologies. In our design part four main individual research parts are included as identifying hand gesture using leap motion, identifying hand using image processing, feature vector creation using image processing and recognize the sign, convert output text to audio. As per the implementation we did, it obtained higher accuracy in recognizing the sign. But there were several limitations in identifying sign as the system was implemented only for recognizing static signs, the accuracy of the system strongly effects on the illumination and brightness of the environment. Our hope is to improve this system to succeed in recognizing dynamic signs as well.Tour Guider – Web based Application System\nJul 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is a web application which provides to tour guide system. This system provides special packages for users. That packages are automatically generate by the system which are satisfy the user’s preferences.

This module is my contribution for this project. In here I am using Microsoft Neural Network Algorithm to train the data set. As the input I choose article title, comments, comment id(for tracking), rating value. As the out put use rating value. Here assumption is usually people comment their article by rating it. normally give high rate for good comment and low rate bad comment. Then the hidden layer train the data set by using them. After that by using DMX query we will able to predict the rate of a particular given comment. As this way I can categorize high rated comments and low rated comments. Then that result goes to text summarizing module and create a summary for both high and low rated comments. That is good for a news publisher to get an idea about, how their readers think about the articles as well as reliability of articles also able to can obtain. \n\nArticle Content Summary module (Reader Side) - This is my next module which I contribute my knowledge to this project.

He has a great deal of understanding about the technologies he used in our project and is always up to date with the new technologies and trends in the industry. There were countless times that he showed commitment, passion and the character during his time with us, which we as a team admire and strive for. He took ownership of every task he was given and completed them with the highest quality that we expect from a high performing individual. Sharfan is eager to learn and always welcomes feedback. He had a great relationship with all the team members helping each other and sharing knowledge and experiences. He has the right attitudes and the mindset that elevates his potential as an engineer. Sharfan has an easy going, friendly and approachable personality that enables him to gel with any team he works in, which was apparent during his stay with us. Apart from the technical expertise the qualities and the people skills he brought to the team was valuable for us to bond as a team.

I consider him to be an engineer with great potential, a wonderful colleague and a close personal friend and any team or an organization would be lucky to have him on their side.\nI have known Sharfan from university then we work together @Inexis.

He always gives freedom to try something new and encourage us to come up with innovative solutions and new technologies. He has tremendous ability to adapt to any kind of situation and come up with best possible solutions. So I have no doubt he will continue to be a great leader and inspire so many people. I wish him very all the best. \nSajeetharan is a person which has a lot of potential to learn new things and develop. I worked with him nearly 5 years. During this period I have seen many things that we completed both together. The experience was an amazing. A special thing about him is that he never says, cannot or no. He will find a solution anyhow. He is a great person to work with at any given time. I recommend him for anybody for what he is today :) \nSajee is great Friend and also a good colleague. He is a very talented individual with great skill sets. As a full-stack developer he managed to develop and manage a product Digin. He managed the team very well and also made a good product with less number of software engineers, He is a Agile person to work with and hope to see him go up the ladder and bring more product to the market.\n \n All the best Sajee\nSajeetharan is an energetic young team member I came across recently in implementing an BI application system. Sajeetharan took up the challenge of leading the development team after a while and performed the duties beyond our normal expectations. He's discipline in following the principles of development procedures and concepts is very admirable. He has great potential and request him to keep performing at the same level.\nIt's rare that you get a chance to work with a person who is highly motivated and committed to what he does like Sajeetharan. I have the pleasure working with him collaborating with several projects. His ability to handle even the toughest clients and urgent situations is impressive. I'm sure Sajeetharan would be an asset to any team.\nSajeetharan is a creative and hardworking person with outgoing personality. Saji and I worked for the same project at Virtusa, which he successfully achieved some of the major challenges in our project. He has the potentiality to learn latest technologies within a short time and apply to software development. He knows how to maintain the work-life balance and a good team player who encouraged others to succeed. \n \n He is a passionate music lover and an artistic person. Very energetic and a charming person.\n \n He will be good knowledge source to the company he works for. I wish him good luck for future!\nSajee is really a good person to hang with, Very flexible guy to work, One of the best I found in documenting projects, I would like to work with him again."}

This increases the isolation of hearing impaired people. This paper presents a system prototype that is able to automatically recognize sign language to help normal people to communicate more effectively with the hearing or speech impaired people. The Sign to Voice system prototype was developed using Feed Forward Neural Network and the gesture input device was a designed sensor glove. This system recognizes both static and dynamic gestures of American Sign Language including the alphabet and a subset of its words, phrases and sentences. Recognized gestures are translated into voice in real time and the voice input is modeled using a 3D model for the recognition of the signer.\n\nOther creators\nmanoj ratnayake Hiranya Nuwan Kumara Malithi Edirisinghe\nSee project Wireless Sign Language InterepreterSee project"

While her forte was in backend development using PHP, given the current situation at the time, Saumini was required to also make fixes and adjustment on the front-end due to some last minute client changes. She on her own initiative learned up both html and CSS, and helped deliver the final product on time. Saumini has also shown much interest in learning new frameworks and platform. She is definitely a positive addition to any development team and I look forward to be able to work with her again in the future.\nI had the pleasure of working with Saumini for over 3 years during our tenure at Vocanic. Saumini is a quick learner and an extremely smart engineer. I found her to be very dependable and a real asset to the team. I'd gladly work with Saumini again in the future!\nSaumini was one the most dependable engineers I have hired or managed. She is extremely good at analytical thinking and being able to troubleshoot tough problems to resolutions. Combined with a capability to deliver projects from scratch to a timeline, Saumini becomes an extremely valuable member of any engineering team. Saumini started at Vocanic delivering custom built apps for clients, after which she worked on VSocial product line, both on frontend and backend. She also briefly owned Mantle, the underlying API layer for VSocial delivering key milestones. Given an opportunity, I'd be glad to work with her again."}

Equipped only with a plier and a Phillips screwdriver,  needless to say, it didn’t end well for me. Today my fortunes are much better. I’d fixed a TV, computers/laptops and even ventured in to restoring old equipment and repairing cars. But I am best building complex web applications for medium to large scale organizations.\n\nFor the last 6 years I have been functioning as a freelance developer available through UpWork. In that time I have worked with established companies, startups and individuals numbering a total of 48 contracts with 100% client satisfaction. Today I develop GivingFire and I love working there. Previously I have had the pleasure to be part of the Orpiva and TextbookValet team.\n\nI am also in the process of starting up a web based startup. I have some ideas that have not been pursued by others. I am spending my free time building the underlying infrastructure for those projects.\n\nProfessionally speaking, I can be identified as a full stack Ruby developer. Most of my portfolio is based on Ruby on Rails.\n\nTechnologies:\n\nServer side: Ruby, Node, PHP, Python\nClient side: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, React, Require.js\nDatabase: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis\nSystem administration: Linux and BSD\n\nIf you would like to connect, feel free to write to me.

It also involves 1st Order Logic to obtain a written Sinhalese output. Statistical methods were implemented to resolve ambiguity. \n\nThe implementation which involves AI techniques was also attempt to resolve information loss using software agents but the method was proved not very successful.\n\nOther creator\nPramod Herath\nProject nameEngSin Translator\nSep 2010 – Nov 2011\n\nProject descriptionEngSin Translator is a rule based machine translator built as an exhibit of EngEx 2010 exhibition. The project is aimed at reducing the language barrier especially when it comes to using the internet.\n\nThe tool comprises of a language decoding unit that understands language structure of basic English sentences. It the does necessary transformations to suit the destination language (Sinhalese) and finally translates using a bilingual dictionary.\n\nThe project served as the foundation the ground research for the SETrans Project which was done in the final year.\nOther creators\nPramod Herath Pasindu Ariyarathna\nProject nameLive Streaming Service\nOct 2011\n\nProject descriptionImplementation of a local video streaming service using Microsoft IIS Live Smooth Streaming and Microsoft Expression encoder.\n\nThe tools were favored over other available tools considering cost and ease to deploy in a small period of time. IIS Live Smooth Streaming which delivers content at bit rates appropriate for the client meant smooth viewing and saving of bandwidth.\n\nProject nameServer Upgrade & Back Up Server Creation\nApr 2011 – Jul 2011\n\nProject descriptionTo research and gain technical know how to update existing out dated server applications and Linux/BSD based systems to there latest stable versions.\n\nIt involved implementing existing Asterisk VOIP servers, Mail Server, LDAP server, Web Server, Proxy Server on latest version of BSD (or some in BSD Jail environments) in VMWare based virtual servers.\n\nThe custom billing module at the Asterisk servers were found not directly portable to the latest version and the use of A2Billing or cusom made module as per new API was suggested.\n\nProject nameImplementation of Cacti Network Monitoring Tool\nJun 2011\n\nProject descriptionAs per the heavy but unexplained use of network bandwidth a network bandwidth monitoring tool was requested to be deployed. After a brief research Cacti was selected due to its informative graphs and deployed in a local server.\n\nThe project which monitored an excessive of 120 switches was used to send requests to entities to reduce unnecessary downloads.\n\nA basic informative video was released to YouTube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQmE4IwNVvo"}

Simply a customer can link his/her credit card to his/her phone, so that customer can send an USSD request to activate the card from his mobile phone, before purchasing and that activation will be last for several minutes (5 minutes). After that period of time card goes to deactivated mode and no transactions can be done without activating the card again.\n\nIt is a big issue that any third party person can use any ones credit/debit card very easily without any authentication (eg: at super markets, fuel stations...). So this project ensures the security of Credit/Debit cards.\n\nThis project was done for the TadHack 2015"}

But in the end due to the factors like the cost, manpower, and the limited time authority decided that we should try and develop the base which is needed to the success of this project. Since the preliminary analysis revealed that the project required a detailed analysis by the experts of soil and the environmental conditions, it has been decided to develop the basic requirement upon which the project can be expanded on a later stage. There included the development of walkways, study center, designs the entrance and information boards.\nSo at the end our task was to develop a study center, which will be used by the students, experts, photographers etc.\n\nOther creators\nPadmasankha Gurusinghe Lahiru Amaratunga Santhuka De Silva Hasith Ranasinghe Hasitha Jayasekara Damitha Nilanka Wijeratne\nSee project Kolonnawa Wetland DevelopmentSee project\nProject nameMunicipal Council Online tender manager - ( Web site - First year Project )\nMar 2012\n\nProject description* Shows Information about municipal council.\n* Users can apply tenders online \n* Admin can see applicants and tender details"}

This module is significant because in real world it has to be dealt with erroneous data.\nIncremental patient matching is a method of identifying duplicate patients very efficiently. \nIn a real world scenario, the requirement would be to match thousands of patients with each other. Once this matching process continues it would be very time consuming since all of the patients are compared with each of them regardless of the fact that two or three new patients are added/updated.\n\nThis was my GSoC project where I had to bring a mechanism to match patients incrementally and I did complete it successfully.\n\nSee project Patient Matching 2.0 - Incremental Patient MatchingSee project\nProject nameDECD\nMar 2016 – Dec 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is a software system that is being developed to Dedicated Economic Centre located in Dambulla, Central province, Sri Lanka.

Computational complexity of this algorithm is minimal compared to most of\nthe existing algorithms for tracking objects. Hence the system is able to track the objects\naccurately and efficiently.\n\nThis is a marker less approach; therefore the main drawback of the prevailing systems is addressed. A video feed taken from a single camera is used to provide relevant\nstatistics and a 3D reconstruction of the game. Creation of a 3D reconstruction (\"Hawk\nEye\") using a single video feed is an integral part of this project. A novel algorithm developed to enable this feature and the algorithm also addresses the theoretical problem of perceiving depth using a single viewpoint. This project proposes a method to accurately calculate the 3D location of the ball using a single video feed and details about the standard tennis court in unison. Furthermore\nthe approach used in the project can be extended to analyze other sports which involve standard courts.\n\nOther creators\nRajith Roshan Chamika Nugegoda Lilantha Nawagamuwa\nSee project Sports Analysis Using Video TrackingSee project\nProject nameSri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad 2013\nMar 2013\n\nProject descriptionSri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad is held annually with the hope of discovering mathematical talent in the country, nurturing them and sending a team to the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).\n\nOther creators\nMaleen Abeydeera Kasun Fernando    Kirshanthan Sundararajah \nSee project Sri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad 2013See project\nProject nameGrid solving Automatic Robot\n2011\n\nProject descriptionCapable of transporting the blocks.\nCapable of search the grid and find out the position of the cauldron."}

Through this research project we tested the hypothesis that learning strong feature representations of images can enhance the semantic understanding of images by machines. Through this project a novel recursive hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the local optima of the number of clusters of a dataset. A hierarchical clustering approach for clustering images into semantically meaningful mixture types based on a recursive hierarchical clustering algorithm prioritizing the most important features from a high dimensional dataset is developed. Secondly a Convolution Neural Network model to extract the visual patterns with regard to attribute mixture types of the images using deep learning schema by training deep representations of the semantically meaningful attribute mixture types is developed. Thirdly a natural language processing module which decrypts the visual patterns from the Convolution Neural Network module to semantically meaningful natural language representations and the querying by open language text has been developed. An integrated system capable of automatic annotating of images using natural language considering the semantic meaning of images is developed by integrating the above mentioned core modules. Furthermore image querying using natural language queries has also been achieved by the system.\n\nTechnologies and tools- Python, MATLAB, Caffe, Tensorflow, Elastic Search, NLTK dependency parser\n\nOther creators\nPavani De Silva Damith Dilshan\nSee project Attribute Based Image Querying SystemSee project\nProject nameReferral Marketing Platform for EduLink Campus\nAug 2015 – Nov 2015\n\nProject descriptionA web based platform to use referral programs to offer current customers incentives to promote company's brand, products, and services.\n\nTechnologies – Angular JS, Nodejs, MongoDB\nOther creator\nDamith Dilshan\nProject nameHospital Management System\nJul 2014 – May 2015\n\nProject descriptionSecond year industry based project done for Winsetha Hospital and was mentored by Pyxle (Pvt) Ltd.

This is a portable device that can be used to mark multiple choice exam papers more accurately and quickly than the currently available methods. Each student is given a device where they will input their answers and at the end of the given time the answers are transferred to the invigilators computer and automatically marked there. This project consisted five group members who contributed their best to deliver it successfully."

During the morning commute there is additional stress because delays caused by traffic can make people late for work. Therefore lack of information about current traffic condition has caused lot of problems in day to life of people.\n\nAs a solution for the above mentioned problems this report refers to a development of a mobile application and a website which can be used to get the reliable traffic data in certain areas. The main source of data is GPS data received form the smart phone. From those it would be possible to identify the location and the moving speed of the vehicle. Therefore the users of this application have to log in to the application in their smartphones that displays crowd sourced data about traffic flows in the area whenever they travel. GPS data will be analyzed via CEP. After analyzing the data accordingly then they are displayed on a map in the android smart phone as well as on a website.\n\ntechnologies used : - - Android Mobile Application ,\n-Webservices \n-java\n-MySql , Siddhi ( a type of Query used to analyze data in Complex event Processor , wso2)Language \n\nProject Supervisor : Mr.Srinath Perera (Vice President, Research at WSO2 Inc.)\nProject Supervisor :Dr .

The system uses the rule based and statistical machine translation techniques. The system is capable of on demand web page translation and it is capable of identifying subject object and verb phrase of a sentence for translation and even it is capable of deciding the form of a word (Inanimate, Masculine or Feminine) and it is transliterating names and places to make more accurate translation. And also the System is capable of handling the language ambiguity to get the more accurate Sinhala translation.CenterPEDE\nApr 2013 – Oct 2013\n\nProject descriptionCenterPEDE (cen·ter·pead) is the performance testing tool developed at Virtusa bringing together the best of the open source and commercial worlds.\n\nCenterPEDE was developed under the following objectives:\n\nAlign and integrate the phases of the performance testing life-cycle.\n\nIncrease the user-friendliness and accelerate the performance testing activities.\n\nNurturing from the robustness of JMeter for web based application performance testing.\n\nProvide comprehensive detailed performance testing results for easier reliable analysis.\n\nLimit the burden on the tool during test execution, to ensure it does not skew the results of the AUT falsely.Online CV System\nAug 2011 – Jul 2012\n\nProject descriptionIn this online CV system we provide facilities to undergraduates to maintain their own profile while they are studying in the university. They can include their details in their own profile and specially their academic qualifications. These unique profiles must be updated daily by either undergraduates or the universities .We ensures that only these two parties can update the profiles. As an example, when a student finishes his/her level -2 in the university, the relevant department or the faculty has the authority to update the profile mentioning the course modules and the grades, that student have obtained. If a student follows an external course they can update their own profiles with that information but they have to prove it by including references. The most important fact is that the system provides the facility to employer companies to know whether the profile is updated by the student or the university. \nWhen the students leave the university after their graduation they have a complete profile with every necessary details. As a result of that employer companies who are willing to work with fresh and young employees can easily get the information regarding the available CV s on the system .The system has the advantage of finding the employees with qualifications by a filtering system. As an example, a company wants to have a new employee who is capable of web developing, programming with 2-year experience in industry. The company only has to enter these qualifications and submit it on to the system. It immediately gives the list of employees who have those qualifications. And by pressing a one single button they can get the printed CV of that employee.Ultimate Transport System for Buses\nFeb 2012 – Mar 2012\n\nProject descriptionAs everyone knows well, there can't be seen a proper time scheduled transportation system in Sri Lanka.

So we came up with a solution for that and we implemented this product in the Colombo Hackathon - The first ever hackathon in Sri Lanka. Simply we use a mobile application and we use Android mobile development and USSD technologies in the mobile application. Main server is run in java Tomcat server. We plan to introduce this product to customers near future through the help of Etiselat mobile partners in Sri Lanka.Automated Message System for Education institutes\nAug 2010 – Jul 2011\n\nProject descriptionThe aim of this project is to develop an Automatic messaging system for students and academic staff members of Universities and Institutes to send and receive academic information through the SMS technology among them and develop a database to store the student’s information. This system will work as a bridge between students and members of the academic staff."

            {"description": "Chinthaka is a very detail oriented person who always achieves his task. He is a very good team player and a very friendly colleague. I highly recommend Chinthaka as a must need key player in a software development team.\nChinthaka is currently working in my banking project and he is a fantastic person to work with. He is hard working and very serious about the deliveries. Chinthaka never refuses you when you ask him for help. Also he can focus on many tasks at once.\nChinthaka was a young Java developer when he was joining with the company. But he was running closer to the senior developers, because of his talent and great personality to work closely with the team. Chinthak is very much eager to learn new techs. He was definitely good value for the company. I wish him very best of luck on his future carrier achievements.\nI have worked on multiple projects with Chinthaka and I find him to be an extremely technical developer. He is very creative and has excellent problem solving skills. He has a great picture and overview of what needs to be accomplished and his design and development for our Java products have been successfully launched because of Chinthaka‘s outstanding accomplishments. Chinthaka works great with his peers and core feature team members and he always had a great working relationship with me and my team. Chinthaka is a huge asset to our team and our organizations success.\nI had a pleasure to work for about 2 years with Chinthaka at the same time and was impressed with the depth of knowledge he possesses. Chinthaka did an exceptional job on the recent project. Chinthaka is a goal oriented, intelligent, responsible and reliable perfectionist. Highly motivated, precise, well educated and creative project manager. Works towards maximal customer satisfaction. Makes the impossible possible\nChinthaka was one of the most dedicated professionals through his work at Sajeewi Soft Solution. Creative natural born leader. Deadline oriented colleague with deep and practical knowledge of software methodologies. I enjoyed working with him on the various projects we took on. It's amazing to work with such a person.\nChinthaka was the first Java developer who came for the interview with a software developed by himself in a compact disk, ready to install and run. He impressed us with this for the first time. Then he started delivering his maximum at every problem he got to solve while playing really well in the team. He is hard working and best at solving complex issues. If I have to describe him in single word, I'd say \"talented\". \nChinthaka is a hard worker and creative problem solver, highly passionate about software development, and always keen to learn more and develop knowledge. Glad to be part of a team, he appreciates an atmosphere of creative and intellectual freedom while focusing on delivering the needs of the client to the tee."}

The aim of Redbox is to provide an elegantly orchestrated and simply connected F&ID business to our Clients. Redbox's vision is to be both a single client portal and smart platform that can coordinate Fraud and ID products across the Experian suite and provide end-to-end client solutions.\nThis elegance and coordination will not come quickly or easily, which is why the Redbox project is split into two phases. The first phase will run through May 2016 and deliver a minimum viable product with a single client access point.\nOther creator\nIroshana Ambalakande Gedara\nSee project RedBoxSee project\nProject nameAdTruth Resolver\nJul 2014\n\nProject descriptionMarketers are inefficient in their ad spend since they are not able to reliably target individuals due to web access channels (e.g. multiple browsers, native apps) and device proliferation. These inefficiencies can be due to factors such as poor conversion analytics, too broadly targeted media or not reaching a customer during their decision journey. \nZander is creating an id for each device and household that can be reliably targeted and analyzed when only anonymous data is present. In addition, Zander will support client supplied attributes such as one way hashed identifiers that are representative of PII. Zander is using all available ids as inputs to create the device level ID. \n\nTechnologies: Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, NoSQL (Aerospike), Amazon Web Services, RabbitMQ, DropWizard, JUnit\n\nOther creators\nAsanka Umesh Iroshana Ambalakande Gedara\nProject nameIron Mountain\nApr 2012"}

It can be either a printed document or even a hand written one. Thereafter the image will be stored into the Amazon's S3 cloud storage, from where the \"Optical Character Recognition\" is being used to convert those tables into charts which could be an interactive way of analyzing. Finally the user will be able to download those charts as an image, as a pdf and so on.

It's a common logic that any relationships which are represented in tables can be also represented as Nodes and Edges that is graph representation. Both the model (Relational Model and Graph Model) based on the common feature of relationships. This project when gets stabled will be contributed to Postgresql developer group and Rogas project where the initial idea was evolved\n\nSee project HeftSee project\nProject nameA Javascript Visualizer and Analyzer\nJan 2014 – Jan 2016\n\nProject descriptionWebsite development is one of the most prominent development areas in software development industry. Developing and maintaining a web site is a difficult task due to the increasing complexity of web site development. The most popular programming language is JavaScript. It is highly dynamic and weakly typed language. Therefore, development tools which are currently available for JavaScript still haven’t reached a level on which the developers can rely on. The main reason for this is that JavaScript frameworks are being developed faster with different architectures and therefore, JavaScript helper tools can become obsolete as soon as new frameworks are introduced.\n\nThere are helper tools available which would analyze a given JavaScript file or generate a call graph for a JavaScript file or generate a dependency graph for a given web site project. However, some of them are no longer supported and most of them depend on other libraries like JavaScript parsers and therefore, those dependencies are needed to run them, which can be a usability problem. Furthermore, none of the previous work or currently available tools were able to generate a call graph dynamically while the website was running, which would immensely facilitate in debugging the web site.\n\nProject nameLie Detector\nApr 2015\n\nProject descriptionA research project to create a framework which could provide functionalities for state securities in their crime investigations to identify criminals from suspects.\n\nProject nameWatch Your Six - Cutting Edge 2013\nMay 2013\n\nProject descriptionA low cost reversing system using ultra sonic motion sensor and Arduino Uno controller.\nOther creators\nMinoli Perera Prathieshna Vekneswaran\nProject nameE-Logic(Robotic arm to help paralyzed patients\nProject descriptionA robot hand which enables the patient to wear it as a glove and give exercise to their arms by giving the minimal support and making it automated. Basically, it will provide exercise to the wrist and elbows to flexion and extension and also joints of the fingers as well as to rotate the thumb. Most importantly it will enable the user (doctor) to insert the number of rotations needed for a particular joint and it will give a positive mentality for the patient to feel he or she is receiving treatment from someone, while being very user friendly."}

The Field Report Writer (FRW) is an application used by Field Engineers, Technical Officers, Sales Teams and other Divisions to generate and manage various types of field reports. Currently different versions of FRW applications are used in two main geographical regions named Region North America (RNA) and Region European Union (REU). The FRW is a client-server application with a workflow engine. The main objective of this project is to re-engineer the current RNA/REU server side (including the workflow) and the client side applications and develop a common application which is compatible for both the regions to ease the maintainability and extensibility. The secondary objective is to use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) instead of Microsoft InfoPath to enhance the look and feel and the user experience while using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) for client server communications.\n\nOther creators"

Database I have used is MySQLMaster Data Project - MAS Holdings\nJan 2016 – Aug 2016\n\nProject descriptionMaster data application is a .net project which act as an interface between SAP and User. Due to lack of functionalities and facilities provided by SAP, Master data project was created.\nThe main task of the application was creating and maintaining the data in SAP. As an example SAP contained data regarding products which MAS create, material they used, customers and vendors of the company and etc. Master data project contained sub projects like customer master and vendor master. Vendor master was done by me. There were several roles of users in the application like requester, 1st approver, 2nd approver and super user. When requester create a data set it should be approved by 1st approver and 2nd approver before sending them to SAP. Until it is send to SAP data were saved in SQL server. Each user is informed by email with relevant link.\nThis is a .net web application which used layered architecture (Client layer, WCF Service layer, Business logic layer and data access layer). Front-end development was done with angularjs because it provide much more functionalities for creating interface, validation and etc. client application layer contained with html files, JavaScript files, angular service and c# controllers. Business logic layer was accessed through WCF service layer. Entity framework and stored procedure were used in Data access layer to work with SQL server. Repository pattern with Generic classes was used for executing functions with database."

How can we create a solution that enables farmers to receive important information vital to their work and also allow them to share information about disease outbreaks and other issues?\nCropAdvisor addresses the above problem. It is an Android app that has information related to crop advisory, the ability to take geo-tagged photographs and upload to a platform for identifying and tracking diseases, and a platform where farmers can advertise to exporters. This is a two way information channel for farmers. It enables farmers to receive the data stored in a central information database. Regarding field preparation, harvesting, packaging, water management, diseases, pesticides etc. Also they can ask their issues through the Android application and receive expert’s feedback.\n\nSee project CropAdvisorSee project\nProject nameDisaster information for public awareness.

Supporting iOS, Android, and Windows devices, it helps organizations deal with both corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE) and employee-owned devices with the bring your own device (BYOD) concept.\n\nWSO2 IoT Server comes with advanced analytics, enabling users to analyze speed, proximity and geo-fencing information of devices including details of those in motion and stationary state.\n\nSee project WSO2 IoT ServerSee project\nProject nameSIYARA Harbour VTMS Mobile Version\nJul 2013 – Apr 2015\n\nProject descriptionAndroid mobile version of Siyara Harbour Vessel Traffic Management System which won the Overall Gold Award and Research and Development Gold award at NBQSA 2013\nOther creators\nChamal Lakshika Poshitha Dabare\nSee project SIYARA Harbour VTMS Mobile VersionSee project\nProject namePublic Complaining System\nOct 2014 – Oct 2014\n\nProject descriptionNBQSA 2014 Gold Awarded project (in Business Category-Tertiary)\n\nThe system contains a web service which can be accessed via a website, mobile app and SMS. Users can post their complaints regarding issues on services, service providers and infrastructure, while other users (including government sectors, private companies, volunteers etc.) can comment and vote on them. This can act as a medium to emphasis the \"real\" problems that already exists among us. This is really beneficial for:\n\ngeneral public : get their problems to responsible parties and get comments/suggestions from others\ncompanies : obtain customer feedbacks and identify the issues to be addressed.\ngovernment authorities : identify the malfunctioning sectors.\nnews agencies : NEWS\nvolunteers : identify the real problems and help to obtain solutions.\n\nOther creators\nPraneeth Peiris Milindu Sanoj Kumarage Dhanushka Chandana \nProject nameSPAM-Bot\nOct 2014 – Oct 2014\n\nProject descriptionThis is an Autonomous Robot designed to navigate across a map and collect payloads distributed at various points. These payloads are delivered at the other end of the map in a sorted order (adjacent to each other with only the last payload on top if the previous one). The sorting is done according to a barcode number printed on each face of the payload.\n\nThe project is build using the Arduino UNO and Arduino duemilanove/ATmega328p boards. It makes use of continuous rotational servos for the wheels of the robot and positional rotational motors for the robot arm and gripper. IR sensors are used to detect and follow the navigational path. A Sonar sensor is used to identify the payloads across the map. A Rasberry Pi connected to a normal Webcam is used to capture the payload key and process it.\n\nOther creators\nShabir Mohamed Praneeth Peiris Madura Anushanga\nSee project SPAM-BotSee project\nProject nameSiyara VTMS\nJan 2013 – Jan 2014\n\nProject descriptionSiyara VTMS is a Vessel Traffic Monitoring Solution(VTMS) for commercial ports which is currently up and running at the Colombo Harbor. It is capable of visualising exact position of ships in a computer simulated environment by decoding Automatic Identification System(AIS) signals. Siyara VTMS won the overall Gold Medal at the NBQSA 2013 award ceremony contesting under research and development category.\n\nOther creators\nPoshitha Dabare  Chamal Lakshika\nSee project Siyara VTMSSee project\nProject nameEVENT iCON\nFeb 2013 – Feb 2013\n\nProject descriptionEVENT iCON is an application which caters both event organizing people and participants. Event organizers can create an event and invite people. Those invited people benefit from this application if they register on the system and have smart\u00ADphones. The concept behind EVENT iCON is an unique one which takes event organizing and communication among participants to a new paradigm.\n\nOther creators\nDulanjan Wengappuliarachchi Asheni Jayawardena Amith Chinthaka \nProject nameIPVC - Image Processing Video Codec\nFeb 2013 – Feb 2013\n\nProject descriptionVideo codec using Image Processing methods(pending)\n\nOther creators\nMadura Anushanga Praneeth Peiris Chamal Lakshika Randa Rasanga Bandara\nProject nameConstruction Project Management System\nJun 2012 – Jun 2012\n\nProject descriptionIt provides the company an attractive web site which promotes their services and products to the customers. The site displays number of constructions the company has built. Since internet is a very popular media, it helps to promote the company more efficiently. \nThe site would help to improve the standards of the company. When a client gets registered through the site they get a personal profile which they can use to communicate with the company. They get the opportunity to get information about their projects by login to their profiles and checking their current process, in addition each profile has a photo gallery which displays photos of their on going project sites. And also there is a BOQ service for users who request that service.\nEmployees of the company also can get registered through the site. So they can check their pay sheets themselves online by login to their profiles.\nThe site gives the opportunity to advertise for other firms/organizations. For that initially an external company can request for this opportunity by filing the form provided.\nIn conclusion this project has successfully fulfilled the above goals providing a fully functional user friendly web portal to the company Dasunie constructions.\nOther creators\nGeesha Weerakoon \nSee project Construction Project Management SystemSee project"

Gamification was utilized to enhance student motivation. 3D games are used as the main learning material. To plan the adaptation 2 main mathematical models were used. The first one is a knowledge model which measures the concept-wise knowledge of users based on a mathematical theory known as Dempster-Shafer Theory. The other one is a fuzzy logic based behavior tracking model which measures the level of interaction and performance of users within the 3D games (Learning Materials). The results of these models are used to deliver an adaptive, interactive and personalized learning experience to the learners. Algorithm construction was done using C# and the game construction was done with Unity 3D and C# scripting.\n\nProject nameEnki\nJan 2012 – Present\n\nProject descriptionIt is a knowledge sharing system specially designed for organizational context.

Its ability to analyze series of events in real time and deduce results based on those events is highly sought after. Today even a handset can be used as a sensor device to generate events for analyzing. The growth of sensor devices has evoked the possibility of event streams that surpass processing capabilities of present CEP products. Hence, new techniques are needed to overcome these issues.\n\n    One suitable solution to overcome the above mentioned challenge is to implement a distributed CEP solution. Distributed solution consists of multiple CEP nodes that run as a single system but are distributed among multiple physically separated machines connected by a network.\n    Although we deploy a distributed system, we cannot achieve theoretical maximum performance due to performance losses arise from several reasons. Main challenges of this project is trying to minimize these losses in order to increase the performance gain.\n    WSO2 CEP will be used as CEP nodes for this project.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage,\n            Sameera Kannangara,\n            Sachini Jayasekara\n\n    Protocol Independent Connectivity interface for Eclipse ECF Salvo Newsreader\n    August 2012 – August 2012\n\n    A project to write protocol independent connectivity interface for Salvo\n    newsreader. Existing implementation was tightly coupled with NNTP protocol.\n    Architectural restructuring was needed to implement a protocol independent\n    connectivity interface.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage\n\n    Test automation for WSO2 ESB\n    July 2012 – August 2012\n\n    This was a hackathon carried out to automate the integration tests of WSO2 ESB and expand its test coverage.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage,\n            Hasintha Indrajee,\n            Harsha Kumara,\n            Andun S.L.

Goal of\n    the project is to implement an email repository connector, which have the ability\n    to connect to an email server and crawl the content.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage\n\n    Tanks - Game Client\n    May 2011 – December 2011\n\n    “Tanks” is an arcade game.

Due to its expansion through merges and acquisitions during the time, each of these factories had their independent and incongruent HR operations and processes running on siloed systems of hSenid HRMenterprise, which led to adopting inherent home grown practices.

For placing and advertising available property of a property owning company, creating, administering e-Contracts for rents and lease to even managing specific repairs/job cards of tenants, REMS provides \"the\" most comprehensive solution managing your real estate. This User-friendly, easy to manage, profile based system also comes with a mobile application for tenants. \nThe project was completed as the 2nd year Industry Project for We Are Designers International (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nOther creators\nNisal Waduge Aeshana shalindra Udadeniya Shakthi Weerasinghe\nSee project Real Estate Management SystemSee project\nProject nameExpressway Life Saver (ELS)\nJan 2015 – Nov 2015\n\nProject description With the increasing population, usage of expressways has been a popular mode of transportation around the world. Although highways cater the speed of life, it compromises the safety of its users which in fact requires more safety measures while traveling in them. Even though, highway statistics provide the fact that the rate at which accidents occur are seemingly low, the impact or the fatality of accidents were very high. Therefore, an autonomous system that would cater all the above problems was in need.\nThe Expressway Life Saver caters this issue by providing efficient accident prevention strategies and post-accident recovery plans. It intends to make the highway systems safer for all the user groups from drivers to passengers by a technological solution. The device is portable and thus convenient to use while traveling. Unlike in other safety systems, it prevents accidents with its speed alerts and keeps the driver in focus with its interactive interface. It alerts the authorities in situations of reckless driving or in an occurrence of a fire or a crash. Also, it backs up highway user data into a database which could be used to the effective handling of the highway system. The system comes as a package of all these features embedded with cutting-edge technology, making it competitive in the marketplace in contrast to its alternatives.\nThe device consists of typical fire sensor and utilizes GSM, GPRS and GPS technologies in order to pass messages and to generate speed, the location of the vehicles. Several test runs were carried out and the outcomes were quite accurate. It responded positively in low signal coverage and resisted quick flames. In overall it was quite a success and could be further developed with the introduction of sophisticated technology.\nOther creators"

            {"description": "A Performance Evaluation for automatically generated Data Mining algorithms in different Machine Learning Libraries\nProject descriptionThis is my final year research project that is currently in progress. This project enables any user, either a novice or expert, to specify a problem related to data mining and write a simple pseudo code using natural language. The natural language specifications are then converted to a universal intermediate model written in XML. The intermediate model is then converted to the actual implementation of the machine learning codes in SKLearn (Python) and R. The results from the different library implementations are compared and an evaluation and interpretation of the results are provided to the user, similar to an expert system. This project was undertaken to allow even novice users to perform analytics and also to evaluate the different libraries/languages with regard to their performance, since most data analysts are familiar with a single library/language. \nMy part of the project is the conversion of the XML model to the actual code. Although conversion of pseudo code to source code is not a new idea, most of the research involves using rule-based approaches. This can be exhaustive as it demands the implementation of a large number of rules and extensive specification of regular expressions. My research involves using a more efficient and automated technique to perform the translations, inspired by techniques of Natural Language Machine Translation(MT) such as Statistical Machine Translation and even Neural Machine Translation. The research is ongoing however, my part of the project most probably needs a hybrid rule-based and MT approach.\nOther creators\nDinusha Harankahawa Madusha Gunasekera\nProject nameA Restaurant Recommendation Engine\nProject descriptionThis project was implemented using a data set collected by the Indian Restaurant Search platform Zomato. The project aimed to recommend to users restaurants based on his/her preference of price range and cuisine type. The restaurants closest to the users price and cuisine preference were identified and recommended to the user after performing the necessary filtering. Techniques of Clustering, classification and Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering were used to implement this engine.\nOther creators\nMadusha Gunasekera Dinusha Harankahawa Milan Karunarathne\nProject nameGamers' Shop Game Store\nProject descriptionThis was the project that our team undertook for the second year academic project. As the name suggests the project is a web based application that allows users to upload and download games. Games are categorized based on categories defined in the store. There are mainly two users, the developers and the players. Many of the features available on the store would require the users to sign up and log in. Games can be downloaded freely or purchased via Pay Pal. Depending on the user's experience, he/she can rate and review games. Games are rated using a star rating system with a scale from 1 to 5. Reviews are basically comments about the user's experience about the game.\nOther creators\nAmjed Anver. Madusha Gunasekera Dinusha Harankahawa\nProject nameMuseum Guide Robot\nProject descriptionThis was a project that was inspired by the lack of technological infrastructure in the museums of Sri Lanka. Instead of separate multimedia systems installed for different galleries/artifacts, a robot was developed, that guides museum visitors along a designated path and provides information about key artifacts in the museum via video. The robot is programmed to stop near the artifacts, identify the location and play a video file relevant to that artifact. This project has the potential to save the huge costs that museums spend on installing multimedia systems since all of these tasks are achieved with one system and is especially ideal to be applied in Sri Lankan museums, where tourists' interest for historical information is a priority on their itineraries."

In open source projects any new contributor can create pull requests or issues. When contributors do one of the following things they always seek for the feedback from the existing contributors (maintainers). As the contributors are unaware when the maintainers will respond them, they have to check the activity of the repository time to time. When contributors are acknowledged properly, it is easy to keep their interest on particular project. The Responder is to acknowledge the contributors in a timely manner and to get the attraction of the maintainers towards the contributors in an efficient manner. This will predict the response time by calculating the average of the initial responses given by the maintainers to previous issues and pull requests. Then a bot can acknowledge the contributors when they can receive a response. Also adding a label to indicate the remaining time will grab the attention of the maintainers and help them in responding to contributors. Other than that maintainers can define categories to issues/pull requests beforehand so that contributors can use them and categorize their issues/pull requests.\n\nSee project ResponderSee project\nProject nameScorum\nOct 2017 – Present\n\nProject descriptionScorum, a platform devoted for undergraduates which assists them in making their academic life easier.

Software industry which steps forward with the innovative technologies always ensure that it is up to date with the latest technology that can be applicable on its operations. Development of a software project passes through various stages of the Software development life cycle. Starting from the requirement gathering stage a specific set of documents has to be created, approved and maintained throughout the process of development. Before commencing the development of a system it should be approved by a set of responsible roles in the company. Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document which states the required functionality of the system is one of the major documents that is to be approved. Most of the companies use a paper based method for the approval process which is handled manually by responsible individuals. However this manual file based system is said to be consists of several drawbacks such as time wastage, less efficiency and resource wastage. In addition the progress of the approval process cannot be monitored through a paper based mechanism. In an effort to overcome these problems ‘FileX’ document approval system introduces a web based application and an iOS mobile application to make the document approval process more efficient. The system facilitates to create projects, assign responsible roles, upload documents, approve SRS document and monitor the progress of approval. The system was evaluated using user centric methods and results indicated that it reduces the time consumed on approval process and reduces the resource wastage making the overall process more effective and convenient. With this respect FileX gives an impressive experience to the user rather than the conventional method.\n\nTechnologies: JSP, Servlets, Oracle Database, JavaScript, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap framework\n\nOther creators\nPraveen Thrilanka Gamage Erandi Atapattu Nishani Abeysinghe Reshani Mihirika\nSee project FileXSee project\nProject nameWeb App - Are You Ready 2016\nOct 2016 – Dec 2016\n\nProject descriptionThe Official Careers Fair of the University of Moratuwa, 'Are You Ready? 2016', which was held for the 21st consecutive time concluded recently. This event that claims a prominent place in the university calendar, was organized by the Career Guidance Unit in collaboration with the Rotaract Club of the University of Moratuwa and was attended by over 1100+ undergraduates and 60+ companies with 80+ interview panels.\n\nThe prime objective of 'Are You Ready?' is to bridge the gap between the soon-to-be graduates and the corporate sector. While preparing undergraduates for recruitment in the industry, it also gives an opportunity for the corporate sector to avail themselves of the talent that the University of Moratuwa has to offer.\n\nThe event was tailored to encompass all areas critical for the success of an undergraduate through its five sessions; The Resume, The Careers Forum, YOU TM, The Exemplar and The Dining Etiquette and Grooming Workshop. The highlight of the event was the Flagship Day held where an approximate 1100+ final year undergraduates were interviewed by companies for recruitment.\n\nTechnologies: JSP, Servlets, MySQL, JavaScript, Maven, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap framework."

The traditional method which prevails currently is where the gem-miners (mine owners) presenting the rough stones to the nearest gem dealer where it’s cut and polished, and sold to another party at much higher price. Such sold gems are passed through several intermediate buyers before reaching the final buyer. The idea of this website/web app is to extract the lump sum of profit stacked in the hands of these intermediaries by connecting the final buyer and the gem miner. Basically, the web app would provide the facility to create profiles to both buyers (foreign/local) and sellers and would the sellers could add their gems to the site through their profiles. Only the cut and polished stones would be published and Sapphire.lk would provide several free cutting and polishing services too if required.\nA most distinguishing feature of this web app is that caters several pains of the users in a realistic way with the use of sophisticated technology. The website uses Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality technologies to provide a realistic 3D image of the gemstone to a remote buyer so that he/she could check for the cracks, intrusions of the gem as if it is at his fingertips.\n\nOther creators\nShakthi Weerasinghe Praveen Thrilanka Gamage Nisal Waduge Randilu Soysa\nSee project Sapphires.lkSee project\nProject namePanelclaw - ClawOS\nAug 2017 – Feb 2018\n\nProject descriptionClawOS is a web based application along with a SaaS platform designed and developed for PanelClaw USA a solar mounting systems manufacturer and lay out designer company located in North Andover MA [https://www.panelclaw.com/]\nClawOS front end is implemented using ReactJS, OpenLayers and Google Maps API on top of NodeJS back-end running in AWS lamda.

This approach enables the developer to migrate between different data sources without changing the business logic.\n\nDesigned and developed a Domain Specific Language (DSL) which is built on top of LINQ that interacts with Duo Object Store framework that integrates with different data sources.\n\nOther creators\nLasitha Senanayake Chinthaka Thiyambarawatte\nProject nameAPIs Developed for DuoV5 Framework/SDK\nProject descriptionDesigned and developed an API that provides localization for DuoV5 apps. A mechanism was developed to create and load language packs. The API also enables the developers to switch between languages during runtime.\n\nDesigned and developed a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) API for the DuoV5 framework that in order to receive voice calls that use a 3rd party browser plugin PortSIP. This API encapsulates the underlying communication while allowing the developers to easily use SIP features.\n\nDesigned and developed an XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) API for Silverlight in order to provide XMPP chat features for DuoV5 apps. BOSH protocol was used to provide two way communications between the DuoV5 Framework and the XMPP server.\n\nDesigned and developed a mechanism to address the problem of nested service calls in Silverlight by allowing the developers to refactor their code in a workflow like hierarchy.\nProject nameDuo Framework Server\nProject descriptionThe objective of Duo Framework server is to provide two way communication facilities between the frontend and the backend servers.\n\nDesigned and developed mechanism to enable the use of multiple protocols such as Web Sockets, HTTP Polling, and TCP.\n\nDesigned and developed a mechanism to recover client connections from network breakdowns to provide high availability and fault tolerance.\nOther creator\nSudharshan Balakrishnan\nProject nameDuo Installer\nProject descriptionThe objective of Duo Installer is to automate the release and deployment process of WCF services, backend servers, DuoV5 Framework, and apps created for DuoV5 Framework.\n\nDeveloped a packaging component known as Setup Creator that enabled the Release Engineer to package all the components and create an installer package. This tool creates a snapshot of an ideal database and all the files of the components and packages everything to a single zip file.\n\nDeveloped a tool to install and update components of the system which are packaged by the Setup Creator. A mechanism was developed to track DB changes, track component changes and to apply such changes by auto generating DB scripts, and by upgrading necessary files of the components. Another mechanism was developed to automate the deployment of WCF services in IIS, as well as to automatically change WCF client endpoint URLs in web.config.\nOther creators\nSudharshan Balakrishnan Chinthaka Thiyambarawatte Lasitha Senanayake\nProject nameDuo Search API\nProject descriptionThe objective of Duo Search API is to provide full text searching capabilities to WCF services in the while reducing the number of database calls.

      "description": "I am an energetic and enthusiastic individual who enjoys a challenge and achieving personal and team goals. My present career aim is to work within IT since I enjoy coding and designing software. I like the environment and find the work quite interesting and satisfying. The opportunity to learn new skills and work with new technologies is particularly attractive to me. I was the Batch Topper at my college for two consecutive years and received a scholarship for my achievements. I passed out with a Bsc in Computer Science with First Class Honors. Apart from my technical expertise in the IT industry, I'm quite fluent in English and have excellent communication skills.\n\nI have approximately 5 years of hands-on experience in the IT industry where I started off as a Software Engineering Intern at OrangeHRM (www.orangehrm.com)  and worked my way up the company to become an Associate Tech Lead. I currently play the role of Technical Lead in our Open Source product (github.com/orangehrm/orangehrm) and the Value Added Services Team, as well as the role of a Senior Software Engineer in the Customizations Department. Since OrangeHRM is a product based company, I have plenty of experience in implementing highly maintainable and clean code with the use of Design Patterns and Test Driven Development. I've mainly worked with PHP frameworks but language is no barrier. I  have conducted workshops and interviews at universities representing OrangeHRM and have also worked with clients based throughout the globe, including Europe and USA.",

      "description": "I'm a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the Curtin University, Australia. I have a total of 15+ years of experience in Programming in various languages which includes 5+ years of post-degree software engineering work experience.\nWhen it comes to software engineering design decision making, I am an individual who prefer performance over modularity where response time is a game changer. I believe simple designs based on few basic concepts as possible results in less buggy, very readable and highly maintainable code. With new libraries/frameworks/design patterns coming in fast, it can be hard to decide which is good. With the knowledge of computing fundamentals, one has to evaluate new technologies and predict/prevent future product failures in performance or maintainability. I believe keeping client’s satisfaction and their smooth operation in mind, is the key to building long term relationships with them.",

So that he or she does not want to bother about an API implementation and they can build up their own API.\n\nInnovation Team\n\nAs an innovation team member I have been working on a supervised bot application which has been implemented using python 2.7 and CISCO SPARK as the platform which is used to replace the messaging platform. In this application the main concept was to having a common platform where any bot can be integrated in to it and used it. \nAfter that I have been working under a project which is using a raspberry 3 with voice recognition through google API. In this project the main tech stack was python 2.7, pyqt5, google voice recognition API. \nAnd then I was assigned a project where it has an indoor navigation system which can guide an associate inside a large scale store to find out the products/items to be collected which has been ordered online. This was a windows mobile application since it uses Bluebird device which is a very powerful device which can be very helpful for scenarios like this. So that it mainly uses visual studio(C#) as the development environment."

We developed a proprietary, patent pending weight management system that receives weight measurements from Wi-Fi scales, allowing us to translate individual’s natural weight fluctuation into a trend. Our interface uses a speedometer type gauge (Change-o-meter™) that anticipates weight trend changes two weeks in advance helping our users understand and control their weight.
