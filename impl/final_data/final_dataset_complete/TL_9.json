Did knows about your customers and your projects and uses the information in your calendar appointments to build your timesheet. Did™ does not make use of any custom plugins for Outlook, but supports simple conventions to allow you to make sure the timesheet is completed automatically. \n\nDid™ builds on standard Outlook functionality such as categories and private marking. Your privates will never be seen in Did, and personal appointments you'd like your colleagues to see, you'll just tag it with a category to have Did™ will automatically ignore it.\n\nWith Did™ the Outlook calendar is now your primary tool for completing your timesheets. All you need to do is to make sure that your schedule is accurate.\u200B\n\nOther creators\nMads Nissen Milan Chauhan Mikael Svenson Indika Rathnasekara Andreas Eide Sachintana Dissanayake Christian Manholt 2+\nSee project Did - The Calendar is the TimesheetSee project\nProject namePlay - Fun and engagement at work\nMar 2012\n\nProject descriptionWith Play, you will be able to have fun with your colleagues at work.
