For placing and advertising available property of a property owning company, creating, administering e-Contracts for rents and lease to even managing specific repairs/job cards of tenants, REMS provides \"the\" most comprehensive solution managing your real estate. This User-friendly, easy to manage, profile based system also comes with a mobile application for tenants. \nThe project was completed as the 2nd year Industry Project for We Are Designers International (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nOther creators\nNisal Waduge Aeshana shalindra Udadeniya Shakthi Weerasinghe\nSee project Real Estate Management SystemSee project\nProject nameExpressway Life Saver (ELS)\nJan 2015 – Nov 2015\n\nProject description With the increasing population, usage of expressways has been a popular mode of transportation around the world. Although highways cater the speed of life, it compromises the safety of its users which in fact requires more safety measures while traveling in them. Even though, highway statistics provide the fact that the rate at which accidents occur are seemingly low, the impact or the fatality of accidents were very high. Therefore, an autonomous system that would cater all the above problems was in need.\nThe Expressway Life Saver caters this issue by providing efficient accident prevention strategies and post-accident recovery plans. It intends to make the highway systems safer for all the user groups from drivers to passengers by a technological solution. The device is portable and thus convenient to use while traveling. Unlike in other safety systems, it prevents accidents with its speed alerts and keeps the driver in focus with its interactive interface. It alerts the authorities in situations of reckless driving or in an occurrence of a fire or a crash. Also, it backs up highway user data into a database which could be used to the effective handling of the highway system. The system comes as a package of all these features embedded with cutting-edge technology, making it competitive in the marketplace in contrast to its alternatives.\nThe device consists of typical fire sensor and utilizes GSM, GPRS and GPS technologies in order to pass messages and to generate speed, the location of the vehicles. Several test runs were carried out and the outcomes were quite accurate. It responded positively in low signal coverage and resisted quick flames. In overall it was quite a success and could be further developed with the introduction of sophisticated technology.\nOther creators"

            {"description": "A Performance Evaluation for automatically generated Data Mining algorithms in different Machine Learning Libraries\nProject descriptionThis is my final year research project that is currently in progress. This project enables any user, either a novice or expert, to specify a problem related to data mining and write a simple pseudo code using natural language. The natural language specifications are then converted to a universal intermediate model written in XML. The intermediate model is then converted to the actual implementation of the machine learning codes in SKLearn (Python) and R. The results from the different library implementations are compared and an evaluation and interpretation of the results are provided to the user, similar to an expert system. This project was undertaken to allow even novice users to perform analytics and also to evaluate the different libraries/languages with regard to their performance, since most data analysts are familiar with a single library/language. \nMy part of the project is the conversion of the XML model to the actual code. Although conversion of pseudo code to source code is not a new idea, most of the research involves using rule-based approaches. This can be exhaustive as it demands the implementation of a large number of rules and extensive specification of regular expressions. My research involves using a more efficient and automated technique to perform the translations, inspired by techniques of Natural Language Machine Translation(MT) such as Statistical Machine Translation and even Neural Machine Translation. The research is ongoing however, my part of the project most probably needs a hybrid rule-based and MT approach.\nOther creators\nDinusha Harankahawa Madusha Gunasekera\nProject nameA Restaurant Recommendation Engine\nProject descriptionThis project was implemented using a data set collected by the Indian Restaurant Search platform Zomato. The project aimed to recommend to users restaurants based on his/her preference of price range and cuisine type. The restaurants closest to the users price and cuisine preference were identified and recommended to the user after performing the necessary filtering. Techniques of Clustering, classification and Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering were used to implement this engine.\nOther creators\nMadusha Gunasekera Dinusha Harankahawa Milan Karunarathne\nProject nameGamers' Shop Game Store\nProject descriptionThis was the project that our team undertook for the second year academic project. As the name suggests the project is a web based application that allows users to upload and download games. Games are categorized based on categories defined in the store. There are mainly two users, the developers and the players. Many of the features available on the store would require the users to sign up and log in. Games can be downloaded freely or purchased via Pay Pal. Depending on the user's experience, he/she can rate and review games. Games are rated using a star rating system with a scale from 1 to 5. Reviews are basically comments about the user's experience about the game.\nOther creators\nAmjed Anver. Madusha Gunasekera Dinusha Harankahawa\nProject nameMuseum Guide Robot\nProject descriptionThis was a project that was inspired by the lack of technological infrastructure in the museums of Sri Lanka. Instead of separate multimedia systems installed for different galleries/artifacts, a robot was developed, that guides museum visitors along a designated path and provides information about key artifacts in the museum via video. The robot is programmed to stop near the artifacts, identify the location and play a video file relevant to that artifact. This project has the potential to save the huge costs that museums spend on installing multimedia systems since all of these tasks are achieved with one system and is especially ideal to be applied in Sri Lankan museums, where tourists' interest for historical information is a priority on their itineraries."

In open source projects any new contributor can create pull requests or issues. When contributors do one of the following things they always seek for the feedback from the existing contributors (maintainers). As the contributors are unaware when the maintainers will respond them, they have to check the activity of the repository time to time. When contributors are acknowledged properly, it is easy to keep their interest on particular project. The Responder is to acknowledge the contributors in a timely manner and to get the attraction of the maintainers towards the contributors in an efficient manner. This will predict the response time by calculating the average of the initial responses given by the maintainers to previous issues and pull requests. Then a bot can acknowledge the contributors when they can receive a response. Also adding a label to indicate the remaining time will grab the attention of the maintainers and help them in responding to contributors. Other than that maintainers can define categories to issues/pull requests beforehand so that contributors can use them and categorize their issues/pull requests.\n\nSee project ResponderSee project\nProject nameScorum\nOct 2017 – Present\n\nProject descriptionScorum, a platform devoted for undergraduates which assists them in making their academic life easier.

Software industry which steps forward with the innovative technologies always ensure that it is up to date with the latest technology that can be applicable on its operations. Development of a software project passes through various stages of the Software development life cycle. Starting from the requirement gathering stage a specific set of documents has to be created, approved and maintained throughout the process of development. Before commencing the development of a system it should be approved by a set of responsible roles in the company. Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document which states the required functionality of the system is one of the major documents that is to be approved. Most of the companies use a paper based method for the approval process which is handled manually by responsible individuals. However this manual file based system is said to be consists of several drawbacks such as time wastage, less efficiency and resource wastage. In addition the progress of the approval process cannot be monitored through a paper based mechanism. In an effort to overcome these problems ‘FileX’ document approval system introduces a web based application and an iOS mobile application to make the document approval process more efficient. The system facilitates to create projects, assign responsible roles, upload documents, approve SRS document and monitor the progress of approval. The system was evaluated using user centric methods and results indicated that it reduces the time consumed on approval process and reduces the resource wastage making the overall process more effective and convenient. With this respect FileX gives an impressive experience to the user rather than the conventional method.\n\nTechnologies: JSP, Servlets, Oracle Database, JavaScript, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap framework\n\nOther creators\nPraveen Thrilanka Gamage Erandi Atapattu Nishani Abeysinghe Reshani Mihirika\nSee project FileXSee project\nProject nameWeb App - Are You Ready 2016\nOct 2016 – Dec 2016\n\nProject descriptionThe Official Careers Fair of the University of Moratuwa, 'Are You Ready? 2016', which was held for the 21st consecutive time concluded recently. This event that claims a prominent place in the university calendar, was organized by the Career Guidance Unit in collaboration with the Rotaract Club of the University of Moratuwa and was attended by over 1100+ undergraduates and 60+ companies with 80+ interview panels.\n\nThe prime objective of 'Are You Ready?' is to bridge the gap between the soon-to-be graduates and the corporate sector. While preparing undergraduates for recruitment in the industry, it also gives an opportunity for the corporate sector to avail themselves of the talent that the University of Moratuwa has to offer.\n\nThe event was tailored to encompass all areas critical for the success of an undergraduate through its five sessions; The Resume, The Careers Forum, YOU TM, The Exemplar and The Dining Etiquette and Grooming Workshop. The highlight of the event was the Flagship Day held where an approximate 1100+ final year undergraduates were interviewed by companies for recruitment.\n\nTechnologies: JSP, Servlets, MySQL, JavaScript, Maven, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap framework."

The traditional method which prevails currently is where the gem-miners (mine owners) presenting the rough stones to the nearest gem dealer where it’s cut and polished, and sold to another party at much higher price. Such sold gems are passed through several intermediate buyers before reaching the final buyer. The idea of this website/web app is to extract the lump sum of profit stacked in the hands of these intermediaries by connecting the final buyer and the gem miner. Basically, the web app would provide the facility to create profiles to both buyers (foreign/local) and sellers and would the sellers could add their gems to the site through their profiles. Only the cut and polished stones would be published and Sapphire.lk would provide several free cutting and polishing services too if required.\nA most distinguishing feature of this web app is that caters several pains of the users in a realistic way with the use of sophisticated technology. The website uses Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality technologies to provide a realistic 3D image of the gemstone to a remote buyer so that he/she could check for the cracks, intrusions of the gem as if it is at his fingertips.\n\nOther creators\nShakthi Weerasinghe Praveen Thrilanka Gamage Nisal Waduge Randilu Soysa\nSee project Sapphires.lkSee project\nProject namePanelclaw - ClawOS\nAug 2017 – Feb 2018\n\nProject descriptionClawOS is a web based application along with a SaaS platform designed and developed for PanelClaw USA a solar mounting systems manufacturer and lay out designer company located in North Andover MA [https://www.panelclaw.com/]\nClawOS front end is implemented using ReactJS, OpenLayers and Google Maps API on top of NodeJS back-end running in AWS lamda.

The traditional method which prevails currently is where the gem-miners (mine owners) presenting the rough stones to the nearest gem dealer where it’s cut and polished, and sold to another party at much higher price. Such sold gems are passed through several intermediate buyers before reaching the final buyer. The idea of this website/web app is to extract the lump sum of profit stacked in the hands of these intermediaries by connecting the final buyer and the gem miner. Basically, the web app would provide the facility to create profiles to both buyers (foreign/local) and sellers and would the sellers could add their gems to the site through their profiles. Only the cut and polished stones would be published and Sapphire.lk would provide several free cutting and polishing services too if required.\nA most distinguishing feature of this web app is that caters several pains of the users in a realistic way with the use of sophisticated technology. The website uses Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality technologies to provide a realistic 3D image of the gemstone to a remote buyer so that he/she could check for the cracks, intrusions of the gem as if it is at his fingertips.\n\nOther creators\nNisal Waduge Aeshana shalindra Udadeniya Randilu Soysa Praveen Thrilanka Gamage\nSee project Sapphires.lkSee project\nProject nameTravel Recommendation System\nSep 2017 – Oct 2017\n\nProject nameMy Chemistry Tutor\nFeb 2017 – May 2017\n\nProject descriptionMy Chemistry tutor is an all platform mobile application that supports learning Chemistry for Ordinay and Advanced level students, being developed for Dialog Ideamart.
