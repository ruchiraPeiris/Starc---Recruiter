Due to its expansion through merges and acquisitions during the time, each of these factories had their independent and incongruent HR operations and processes running on siloed systems of hSenid HRMenterprise, which led to adopting inherent home grown practices. The challenge was to get a consolidated view of HR operations and KPIs. \\nIn addition, the lack of a standard solution throughout the organisation led to audit issues, compliance violations and fraud. Thus, the objective was to streamline processes, standardise the key HR functions across the entire group and have a single centralized solution with embedded industry best practices which would provide the ability to receive consolidated information from across the group which enables better control over all factories within the group for strategic decision making. \\nOther creators\\nAfham Mohamed Ali Sampath Gunawardena Sanath Wickremasinghe, PMP, CSM Noel Arokiam Yuwanmini Landersz Thilanchana Bandaranayake Nuwan Lorensuhewa 8+\\nProject nameeSamurdhi HRM\\nApr 2011\\n\\nProject descriptioneSamurdhi online is an award winning complex Information System which involved an integration of the Symfony framework and a customized HR management solution with the Web based HRM solution.

Also features a new way of\nHuman computer interaction and virtual shopping by use of hand gestures and augmented reality.\nis a system built by the use of mixed reality. Main objective of “Project Third-Eye” is to increase the overall human computer interaction using hand gestures. The system consists of three main components. A backend framework, a Sub-OS built on top of the framework, and an applications layer. The framework combines several computer vision libraries to creates a more high level and easier to use environment for developers. The framework is the bottom-most layer of all the applications running on the “Project Third-Eye” Framework and is responsible for interacting with hardware devices. It is also developed to encourage other developers to portray their own innovative ideas using this framework. \n\nProject “Third-Eye” will allow users to interact with the computer using hand gestures, perform various activities such as video viewing and picture viewing. Apart from that, using the two applications that will be built on the application layer, users can create 3D architectural designs in a virtual/augmented environment, and by using the Try-before-you-buy application users can try-out clothes, accessories before buying them virtually, by accessing online stores.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n- Involved in designing the framework architecture, implementation of hand gesture recognition.\n- Involved in all of the 3D modelling and animation of the project.\n\nOther creator\nRoshan Gamage\nProject nameTask Completion Monitoring System\nApr 2011\n\nProject descriptionWeb solution which allows a user to monitor tasks performed worldwide in different time zones.
