The Field Report Writer (FRW) is an application used by Field Engineers, Technical Officers, Sales Teams and other Divisions to generate and manage various types of field reports. Currently different versions of FRW applications are used in two main geographical regions named Region North America (RNA) and Region European Union (REU). The FRW is a client-server application with a workflow engine. The main objective of this project is to re-engineer the current RNA/REU server side (including the workflow) and the client side applications and develop a common application which is compatible for both the regions to ease the maintainability and extensibility. The secondary objective is to use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) instead of Microsoft InfoPath to enhance the look and feel and the user experience while using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) for client server communications.\n\nOther creators"
