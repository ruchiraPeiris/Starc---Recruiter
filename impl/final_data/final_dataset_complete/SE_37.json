We developed a proprietary, patent pending weight management system that receives weight measurements from Wi-Fi scales, allowing us to translate individual’s natural weight fluctuation into a trend. Our interface uses a speedometer type gauge (Change-o-meter™) that anticipates weight trend changes two weeks in advance helping our users understand and control their weight.

Upon registration, a one-time sentiment analysis of posted “check-ins” of the user will be conducted which derives an explicit rating for each location visited by the user, to identify the user’s travel preferences. \n\nBased on the identified preferences, unvisited locations in any city in Sri Lanka can be rated by a state-of-the-art recommender implementing a user-based collaborating filtering technique. The uniqueness of the solution rests in the use of social media data available on Facebook to identify user preferences and the logic of the recommendation system which can robustly handle the cold start problems. \n\n“TravelSL” is extremely user-friendly as it then designs an optimum route covering top recommended locations based on the traveling mode, distance, predicted rating and existing reservations for each location made visible to the user on Google Maps.\n\nTechnologies Used: Python 3.x, Mongo DB, Android StudioEmbla Sphere - HR Portal\nMar 2016 – Aug 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is implemented as an internal project of the Embla Software Innovation Pvt Ltd. This is an HR Management system which basically helps to record the information of employees and allowing to see their average working hours, late attendance, remaining and taken leaves and missed punch records. Apart from that, this system facilitates the employees to apply leaves based on their allocations. \n\nTechnologies used: Angular 1.x, Web API2, SQL Server Management Studio, Repository Design Pattern, Unit of work"

The young owner of the Salon Shani, Mrs. Erandi is the client to this\nproject. The website will enhance and help to promote Mrs. Erandi’s business by providing a\nway to publish her good work and get more customers through the website.Web based system for audio monitoring\nJan 2014\n\nProject descriptionThe purpose of the project is to assist the relevant authorities to enforce the Intellectual Property Act of Sri Lanka. The system would monitor all the radio stations in Sri Lanka and provide a report consisting of the songs played by the radio station, which would allow OSCA ( Outstanding Song Creators' Association - The Client ) to send the radio stations invoices and charge them for the songs played thereby provide the flow of royalties to the copyright holders of the songs. We were provided with the song identification algorithm and we developed a web based solution connecting it to our system which facilitates storing all the details and viewing reports at the end of a certain period of time."

Therefore, in this dissertation, our aim was to propose a system which facilitate the communication between normal and deaf people. Same problem has been addressed by using different techniques in different approaches, but they are for facilitating languages other than Sinhala language. To implement our proposed system, leap motion controller, image processing techniques, NLP module, Weka tool and Festival framework has been selected as technologies. In our design part four main individual research parts are included as identifying hand gesture using leap motion, identifying hand using image processing, feature vector creation using image processing and recognize the sign, convert output text to audio. As per the implementation we did, it obtained higher accuracy in recognizing the sign. But there were several limitations in identifying sign as the system was implemented only for recognizing static signs, the accuracy of the system strongly effects on the illumination and brightness of the environment. Our hope is to improve this system to succeed in recognizing dynamic signs as well.Tour Guider – Web based Application System\nJul 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is a web application which provides to tour guide system. This system provides special packages for users. That packages are automatically generate by the system which are satisfy the user’s preferences. And also the selected package gives details about what are the places the user can stay. It includes route direction, hotels, resort, rest houses and details about that place.\nTechnologies Used – C#, ASP.Net Framework, MVC 5 Architecture, Ajax, JSON, MS Sql, Visual Studio 2015, HTML, CSS and Java Script.Automated Garage Helper\nMay 2015\n\nProject descriptionAutomated Garage Helper - An automated system which helps the motor mechanic of a garage to manage and bring equipment and tools.Technologies Used – Microcontrollers, RF modules, IR sensor technologies, Embedded system, Micro C"

This module is my contribution for this project. In here I am using Microsoft Neural Network Algorithm to train the data set. As the input I choose article title, comments, comment id(for tracking), rating value. As the out put use rating value. Here assumption is usually people comment their article by rating it. normally give high rate for good comment and low rate bad comment. Then the hidden layer train the data set by using them. After that by using DMX query we will able to predict the rate of a particular given comment. As this way I can categorize high rated comments and low rated comments. Then that result goes to text summarizing module and create a summary for both high and low rated comments. That is good for a news publisher to get an idea about, how their readers think about the articles as well as reliability of articles also able to can obtain. \n\nArticle Content Summary module (Reader Side) - This is my next module which I contribute my knowledge to this project.
