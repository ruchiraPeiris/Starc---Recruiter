We developed a proprietary, patent pending weight management system that receives weight measurements from Wi-Fi scales, allowing us to translate individual’s natural weight fluctuation into a trend.

The project was agile, hence constant communication with Yasas throughout the project from planning to daily scrums.\n \n Yasas is a very talented and hard working young man with a lot of potential. Yasas is very innovative and always looking for new solutions and fresh ideas that can advance his knowledge to exceed expectations and goals. He is passionate about his work and always seems to have great awareness of new creative strategies and technology.\n \n Yasas is dedicated, enthusiastic, intelligent, and responsible.\n \n The project was a complicated and complexed new technology initiative that required a lot of attention / effort, learning and team work. Yasas's dedication & contribution to this initiative set us up well to make the project a success.\n \n Edmund Sanjeev\n Systems Analyst/ Product Owner \n Icon Global\n Edmund.sanjeev@iconglobal.com.au\\nYasas is a highly-motivated, focused and talented individual who always looking for new challenges. We worked together in 99X Technology on a project which delivered single page web application as a modernization of a legacy healthcare management system. Yasas did a wonderful job in this project by automating the delivery chain using cloud infrastructure of AWS with a modern toolchain and best practices. This greatly increased developer productivity and shortened the development cycle.Ability to taking the ownership of what he get assigned is the rare quality I see in Yasas. Moreover, he got great analytical, programming and presentation skills. I undoubtedly recommend him for any future endeavor which these qualities matter.\nYasas was an excellent intern I worked with very recently. He is magically super fast in grabbing knowledge and being a master of it. He is extremely good at explaining what he knows to the other team members very clearly. He is ultra dependable and you don't need to have any worries about the tasks you give to him. His attitude towards work is extremely great. He is always result driven. I highly recommend him for any project. \nI have had the pleasure of working with Yasas in my capacity as a volunteer and the Programme Director of SL2College. Yasas initially joined SL2College as a Speaker at SL Inspire School Seminars. Given his impressive work ethic and dedication to the team, I asked him to take up the position of Assistant Programme Manager in the seminar team, where he was responsible for organising and coordinating the ground level activities of numerous seminars. One of the many challenges when working with volunteers is the lack of accountability. Yasas is one of the few individuals with whom this is not an issue. When he takes on a responsibility we have complete faith that he would deliver. Furthermore, he is a great public speaker and I have personally witnessed him inspiring hundreds of young school students to pursue higher education."}

Upon registration, a one-time sentiment analysis of posted “check-ins” of the user will be conducted which derives an explicit rating for each location visited by the user, to identify the user’s travel preferences. \n\nBased on the identified preferences, unvisited locations in any city in Sri Lanka can be rated by a state-of-the-art recommender implementing a user-based collaborating filtering technique. The uniqueness of the solution rests in the use of social media data available on Facebook to identify user preferences and the logic of the recommendation system which can robustly handle the cold start problems. \n\n“TravelSL” is extremely user-friendly as it then designs an optimum route covering top recommended locations based on the traveling mode, distance, predicted rating and existing reservations for each location made visible to the user on Google Maps.\n\nTechnologies Used: Python 3.x, Mongo DB, Android StudioEmbla Sphere - HR Portal\nMar 2016 – Aug 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is implemented as an internal project of the Embla Software Innovation Pvt Ltd. This is an HR Management system which basically helps to record the information of employees and allowing to see their average working hours, late attendance, remaining and taken leaves and missed punch records. Apart from that, this system facilitates the employees to apply leaves based on their allocations. \n\nTechnologies used: Angular 1.x, Web API2, SQL Server Management Studio, Repository Design Pattern, Unit of work"

Therefore, in this dissertation, our aim was to propose a system which facilitate the communication between normal and deaf people. Same problem has been addressed by using different techniques in different approaches, but they are for facilitating languages other than Sinhala language. To implement our proposed system, leap motion controller, image processing techniques, NLP module, Weka tool and Festival framework has been selected as technologies. In our design part four main individual research parts are included as identifying hand gesture using leap motion, identifying hand using image processing, feature vector creation using image processing and recognize the sign, convert output text to audio. As per the implementation we did, it obtained higher accuracy in recognizing the sign. But there were several limitations in identifying sign as the system was implemented only for recognizing static signs, the accuracy of the system strongly effects on the illumination and brightness of the environment. Our hope is to improve this system to succeed in recognizing dynamic signs as well.Tour Guider – Web based Application System\nJul 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is a web application which provides to tour guide system.

This module is my contribution for this project. In here I am using Microsoft Neural Network Algorithm to train the data set. As the input I choose article title, comments, comment id(for tracking), rating value. As the out put use rating value. Here assumption is usually people comment their article by rating it. normally give high rate for good comment and low rate bad comment. Then the hidden layer train the data set by using them. After that by using DMX query we will able to predict the rate of a particular given comment. As this way I can categorize high rated comments and low rated comments. Then that result goes to text summarizing module and create a summary for both high and low rated comments. That is good for a news publisher to get an idea about, how their readers think about the articles as well as reliability of articles also able to can obtain. \n\nArticle Content Summary module (Reader Side) - This is my next module which I contribute my knowledge to this project.

He has a great deal of understanding about the technologies he used in our project and is always up to date with the new technologies and trends in the industry. There were countless times that he showed commitment, passion and the character during his time with us, which we as a team admire and strive for. He took ownership of every task he was given and completed them with the highest quality that we expect from a high performing individual. Sharfan is eager to learn and always welcomes feedback. He had a great relationship with all the team members helping each other and sharing knowledge and experiences. He has the right attitudes and the mindset that elevates his potential as an engineer. Sharfan has an easy going, friendly and approachable personality that enables him to gel with any team he works in, which was apparent during his stay with us. Apart from the technical expertise the qualities and the people skills he brought to the team was valuable for us to bond as a team. He is an absolute joy to work with and there is never a dull moment when he is around. I consider him to be an engineer with great potential, a wonderful colleague and a close personal friend and any team or an organization would be lucky to have him on their side.\nI have known Sharfan from university then we work together @Inexis. He worked with me on a couple of projects and he has a great team player attitude and can do attitude. He can move with new technologies in a short time period and he has good communication skills.

He always gives freedom to try something new and encourage us to come up with innovative solutions and new technologies. He has tremendous ability to adapt to any kind of situation and come up with best possible solutions. So I have no doubt he will continue to be a great leader and inspire so many people. I wish him very all the best. \nSajeetharan is a person which has a lot of potential to learn new things and develop. I worked with him nearly 5 years. During this period I have seen many things that we completed both together. The experience was an amazing. A special thing about him is that he never says, cannot or no. He will find a solution anyhow. He is a great person to work with at any given time. I recommend him for anybody for what he is today :) \nSajee is great Friend and also a good colleague. He is a very talented individual with great skill sets. As a full-stack developer he managed to develop and manage a product Digin. He managed the team very well and also made a good product with less number of software engineers, He is a Agile person to work with and hope to see him go up the ladder and bring more product to the market.\n \n All the best Sajee\nSajeetharan is an energetic young team member I came across recently in implementing an BI application system. Sajeetharan took up the challenge of leading the development team after a while and performed the duties beyond our normal expectations. He's discipline in following the principles of development procedures and concepts is very admirable. He has great potential and request him to keep performing at the same level.\nIt's rare that you get a chance to work with a person who is highly motivated and committed to what he does like Sajeetharan. I have the pleasure working with him collaborating with several projects. His ability to handle even the toughest clients and urgent situations is impressive. I'm sure Sajeetharan would be an asset to any team.\nSajeetharan is a creative and hardworking person with outgoing personality. Saji and I worked for the same project at Virtusa, which he successfully achieved some of the major challenges in our project. He has the potentiality to learn latest technologies within a short time and apply to software development. He knows how to maintain the work-life balance and a good team player who encouraged others to succeed. \n \n He is a passionate music lover and an artistic person. Very energetic and a charming person.\n \n He will be good knowledge source to the company he works for. I wish him good luck for future!\nSajee is really a good person to hang with, Very flexible guy to work, One of the best I found in documenting projects, I would like to work with him again."}

This increases the isolation of hearing impaired people. This paper presents a system prototype that is able to automatically recognize sign language to help normal people to communicate more effectively with the hearing or speech impaired people. The Sign to Voice system prototype was developed using Feed Forward Neural Network and the gesture input device was a designed sensor glove. This system recognizes both static and dynamic gestures of American Sign Language including the alphabet and a subset of its words, phrases and sentences. Recognized gestures are translated into voice in real time and the voice input is modeled using a 3D model for the recognition of the signer.\n\nOther creators\nmanoj ratnayake Hiranya Nuwan Kumara Malithi Edirisinghe\nSee project Wireless Sign Language InterepreterSee project"

While her forte was in backend development using PHP, given the current situation at the time, Saumini was required to also make fixes and adjustment on the front-end due to some last minute client changes. She on her own initiative learned up both html and CSS, and helped deliver the final product on time. Saumini has also shown much interest in learning new frameworks and platform. She is definitely a positive addition to any development team and I look forward to be able to work with her again in the future.\nI had the pleasure of working with Saumini for over 3 years during our tenure at Vocanic. Saumini is a quick learner and an extremely smart engineer. I found her to be very dependable and a real asset to the team. I'd gladly work with Saumini again in the future!\nSaumini was one the most dependable engineers I have hired or managed. She is extremely good at analytical thinking and being able to troubleshoot tough problems to resolutions. Combined with a capability to deliver projects from scratch to a timeline, Saumini becomes an extremely valuable member of any engineering team. Saumini started at Vocanic delivering custom built apps for clients, after which she worked on VSocial product line, both on frontend and backend. She also briefly owned Mantle, the underlying API layer for VSocial delivering key milestones. Given an opportunity, I'd be glad to work with her again."}

Equipped only with a plier and a Phillips screwdriver,  needless to say, it didn’t end well for me. Today my fortunes are much better. I’d fixed a TV, computers/laptops and even ventured in to restoring old equipment and repairing cars. But I am best building complex web applications for medium to large scale organizations.\n\nFor the last 6 years I have been functioning as a freelance developer available through UpWork. In that time I have worked with established companies, startups and individuals numbering a total of 48 contracts with 100% client satisfaction. Today I develop GivingFire and I love working there. Previously I have had the pleasure to be part of the Orpiva and TextbookValet team.\n\nI am also in the process of starting up a web based startup. I have some ideas that have not been pursued by others. I am spending my free time building the underlying infrastructure for those projects.\n\nProfessionally speaking, I can be identified as a full stack Ruby developer. Most of my portfolio is based on Ruby on Rails.\n\nTechnologies:\n\nServer side: Ruby, Node, PHP, Python\nClient side: HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, React, Require.js\nDatabase: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis\nSystem administration: Linux and BSD\n\nIf you would like to connect, feel free to write to me.

It also involves 1st Order Logic to obtain a written Sinhalese output. Statistical methods were implemented to resolve ambiguity. \n\nThe implementation which involves AI techniques was also attempt to resolve information loss using software agents but the method was proved not very successful.\n\nOther creator\nPramod Herath\nProject nameEngSin Translator\nSep 2010 – Nov 2011\n\nProject descriptionEngSin Translator is a rule based machine translator built as an exhibit of EngEx 2010 exhibition. The project is aimed at reducing the language barrier especially when it comes to using the internet.\n\nThe tool comprises of a language decoding unit that understands language structure of basic English sentences. It the does necessary transformations to suit the destination language (Sinhalese) and finally translates using a bilingual dictionary.\n\nThe project served as the foundation the ground research for the SETrans Project which was done in the final year.\nOther creators\nPramod Herath Pasindu Ariyarathna\nProject nameLive Streaming Service\nOct 2011\n\nProject descriptionImplementation of a local video streaming service using Microsoft IIS Live Smooth Streaming and Microsoft Expression encoder.\n\nThe tools were favored over other available tools considering cost and ease to deploy in a small period of time. IIS Live Smooth Streaming which delivers content at bit rates appropriate for the client meant smooth viewing and saving of bandwidth.\n\nProject nameServer Upgrade & Back Up Server Creation\nApr 2011 – Jul 2011\n\nProject descriptionTo research and gain technical know how to update existing out dated server applications and Linux/BSD based systems to there latest stable versions.\n\nIt involved implementing existing Asterisk VOIP servers, Mail Server, LDAP server, Web Server, Proxy Server on latest version of BSD (or some in BSD Jail environments) in VMWare based virtual servers.\n\nThe custom billing module at the Asterisk servers were found not directly portable to the latest version and the use of A2Billing or cusom made module as per new API was suggested.\n\nProject nameImplementation of Cacti Network Monitoring Tool\nJun 2011\n\nProject descriptionAs per the heavy but unexplained use of network bandwidth a network bandwidth monitoring tool was requested to be deployed. After a brief research Cacti was selected due to its informative graphs and deployed in a local server.\n\nThe project which monitored an excessive of 120 switches was used to send requests to entities to reduce unnecessary downloads.\n\nA basic informative video was released to YouTube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQmE4IwNVvo"}

Simply a customer can link his/her credit card to his/her phone, so that customer can send an USSD request to activate the card from his mobile phone, before purchasing and that activation will be last for several minutes (5 minutes). After that period of time card goes to deactivated mode and no transactions can be done without activating the card again.\n\nIt is a big issue that any third party person can use any ones credit/debit card very easily without any authentication (eg: at super markets, fuel stations...). So this project ensures the security of Credit/Debit cards.\n\nThis project was done for the TadHack 2015"}

This module is significant because in real world it has to be dealt with erroneous data.\nIncremental patient matching is a method of identifying duplicate patients very efficiently. \nIn a real world scenario, the requirement would be to match thousands of patients with each other. Once this matching process continues it would be very time consuming since all of the patients are compared with each of them regardless of the fact that two or three new patients are added/updated.\n\nThis was my GSoC project where I had to bring a mechanism to match patients incrementally and I did complete it successfully.\n\nSee project Patient Matching 2.0 - Incremental Patient MatchingSee project\nProject nameDECD\nMar 2016 – Dec 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is a software system that is being developed to Dedicated Economic Centre located in Dambulla, Central province, Sri Lanka.

             {"description": "Sports Analysis Using Video Tracking\nApr 2015\n\nProject descriptionThe proposed system analyzes sports videos by implementing a robust object tracking\nalgorithm. Computational complexity of this algorithm is minimal compared to most of\nthe existing algorithms for tracking objects. Hence the system is able to track the objects\naccurately and efficiently.\n\nThis is a marker less approach; therefore the main drawback of the prevailing systems is addressed. A video feed taken from a single camera is used to provide relevant\nstatistics and a 3D reconstruction of the game. Creation of a 3D reconstruction (\"Hawk\nEye\") using a single video feed is an integral part of this project. A novel algorithm developed to enable this feature and the algorithm also addresses the theoretical problem of perceiving depth using a single viewpoint. This project proposes a method to accurately calculate the 3D location of the ball using a single video feed and details about the standard tennis court in unison. Furthermore\nthe approach used in the project can be extended to analyze other sports which involve standard courts.\n\nOther creators\nRajith Roshan Chamika Nugegoda Lilantha Nawagamuwa\nSee project Sports Analysis Using Video TrackingSee project\nProject nameSri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad 2013\nMar 2013\n\nProject descriptionSri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad is held annually with the hope of discovering mathematical talent in the country, nurturing them and sending a team to the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).\n\nOther creators\nMaleen Abeydeera Kasun Fernando    Kirshanthan Sundararajah \nSee project Sri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad 2013See project\nProject nameGrid solving Automatic Robot\n2011\n\nProject descriptionCapable of transporting the blocks.\nCapable of search the grid and find out the position of the cauldron."}
