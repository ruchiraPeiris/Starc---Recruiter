How can we create a solution that enables farmers to receive important information vital to their work and also allow them to share information about disease outbreaks and other issues?\nCropAdvisor addresses the above problem. It is an Android app that has information related to crop advisory, the ability to take geo-tagged photographs and upload to a platform for identifying and tracking diseases, and a platform where farmers can advertise to exporters. This is a two way information channel for farmers. It enables farmers to receive the data stored in a central information database. Regarding field preparation, harvesting, packaging, water management, diseases, pesticides etc. Also they can ask their issues through the Android application and receive expert’s feedback.\n\nSee project CropAdvisorSee project\nProject nameDisaster information for public awareness.

Supporting iOS, Android, and Windows devices, it helps organizations deal with both corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE) and employee-owned devices with the bring your own device (BYOD) concept.\n\nWSO2 IoT Server comes with advanced analytics, enabling users to analyze speed, proximity and geo-fencing information of devices including details of those in motion and stationary state.\n\nSee project WSO2 IoT ServerSee project\nProject nameSIYARA Harbour VTMS Mobile Version\nJul 2013 – Apr 2015\n\nProject descriptionAndroid mobile version of Siyara Harbour Vessel Traffic Management System which won the Overall Gold Award and Research and Development Gold award at NBQSA 2013\nOther creators\nChamal Lakshika Poshitha Dabare\nSee project SIYARA Harbour VTMS Mobile VersionSee project\nProject namePublic Complaining System\nOct 2014 – Oct 2014\n\nProject descriptionNBQSA 2014 Gold Awarded project (in Business Category-Tertiary)\n\nThe system contains a web service which can be accessed via a website, mobile app and SMS. Users can post their complaints regarding issues on services, service providers and infrastructure, while other users (including government sectors, private companies, volunteers etc.) can comment and vote on them. This can act as a medium to emphasis the \"real\" problems that already exists among us. This is really beneficial for:\n\ngeneral public : get their problems to responsible parties and get comments/suggestions from others\ncompanies : obtain customer feedbacks and identify the issues to be addressed.\ngovernment authorities : identify the malfunctioning sectors.\nnews agencies : NEWS\nvolunteers : identify the real problems and help to obtain solutions.\n\nOther creators\nPraneeth Peiris Milindu Sanoj Kumarage Dhanushka Chandana \nProject nameSPAM-Bot\nOct 2014 – Oct 2014\n\nProject descriptionThis is an Autonomous Robot designed to navigate across a map and collect payloads distributed at various points. These payloads are delivered at the other end of the map in a sorted order (adjacent to each other with only the last payload on top if the previous one). The sorting is done according to a barcode number printed on each face of the payload.\n\nThe project is build using the Arduino UNO and Arduino duemilanove/ATmega328p boards. It makes use of continuous rotational servos for the wheels of the robot and positional rotational motors for the robot arm and gripper. IR sensors are used to detect and follow the navigational path. A Sonar sensor is used to identify the payloads across the map. A Rasberry Pi connected to a normal Webcam is used to capture the payload key and process it.\n\nOther creators\nShabir Mohamed Praneeth Peiris Madura Anushanga\nSee project SPAM-BotSee project\nProject nameSiyara VTMS\nJan 2013 – Jan 2014\n\nProject descriptionSiyara VTMS is a Vessel Traffic Monitoring Solution(VTMS) for commercial ports which is currently up and running at the Colombo Harbor. It is capable of visualising exact position of ships in a computer simulated environment by decoding Automatic Identification System(AIS) signals. Siyara VTMS won the overall Gold Medal at the NBQSA 2013 award ceremony contesting under research and development category.\n\nOther creators\nPoshitha Dabare  Chamal Lakshika\nSee project Siyara VTMSSee project\nProject nameEVENT iCON\nFeb 2013 – Feb 2013\n\nProject descriptionEVENT iCON is an application which caters both event organizing people and participants. Event organizers can create an event and invite people. Those invited people benefit from this application if they register on the system and have smart\u00ADphones. The concept behind EVENT iCON is an unique one which takes event organizing and communication among participants to a new paradigm.\n\nOther creators\nDulanjan Wengappuliarachchi Asheni Jayawardena Amith Chinthaka \nProject nameIPVC - Image Processing Video Codec\nFeb 2013 – Feb 2013\n\nProject descriptionVideo codec using Image Processing methods(pending)\n\nOther creators\nMadura Anushanga Praneeth Peiris Chamal Lakshika Randa Rasanga Bandara\nProject nameConstruction Project Management System\nJun 2012 – Jun 2012\n\nProject descriptionIt provides the company an attractive web site which promotes their services and products to the customers. The site displays number of constructions the company has built. Since internet is a very popular media, it helps to promote the company more efficiently. \nThe site would help to improve the standards of the company. When a client gets registered through the site they get a personal profile which they can use to communicate with the company. They get the opportunity to get information about their projects by login to their profiles and checking their current process, in addition each profile has a photo gallery which displays photos of their on going project sites. And also there is a BOQ service for users who request that service.\nEmployees of the company also can get registered through the site. So they can check their pay sheets themselves online by login to their profiles.\nThe site gives the opportunity to advertise for other firms/organizations. For that initially an external company can request for this opportunity by filing the form provided.\nIn conclusion this project has successfully fulfilled the above goals providing a fully functional user friendly web portal to the company Dasunie constructions.\nOther creators\nGeesha Weerakoon \nSee project Construction Project Management SystemSee project"

Gamification was utilized to enhance student motivation. 3D games are used as the main learning material. To plan the adaptation 2 main mathematical models were used. The first one is a knowledge model which measures the concept-wise knowledge of users based on a mathematical theory known as Dempster-Shafer Theory. The other one is a fuzzy logic based behavior tracking model which measures the level of interaction and performance of users within the 3D games (Learning Materials). The results of these models are used to deliver an adaptive, interactive and personalized learning experience to the learners. Algorithm construction was done using C# and the game construction was done with Unity 3D and C# scripting.\n\nProject nameEnki\nJan 2012 – Present\n\nProject descriptionIt is a knowledge sharing system specially designed for organizational context.

Its ability to analyze series of events in real time and deduce results based on those events is highly sought after. Today even a handset can be used as a sensor device to generate events for analyzing. The growth of sensor devices has evoked the possibility of event streams that surpass processing capabilities of present CEP products. Hence, new techniques are needed to overcome these issues.\n\n    One suitable solution to overcome the above mentioned challenge is to implement a distributed CEP solution. Distributed solution consists of multiple CEP nodes that run as a single system but are distributed among multiple physically separated machines connected by a network.\n    Although we deploy a distributed system, we cannot achieve theoretical maximum performance due to performance losses arise from several reasons. Main challenges of this project is trying to minimize these losses in order to increase the performance gain.\n    WSO2 CEP will be used as CEP nodes for this project.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage,\n            Sameera Kannangara,\n            Sachini Jayasekara\n\n    Protocol Independent Connectivity interface for Eclipse ECF Salvo Newsreader\n    August 2012 – August 2012\n\n    A project to write protocol independent connectivity interface for Salvo\n    newsreader. Existing implementation was tightly coupled with NNTP protocol.\n    Architectural restructuring was needed to implement a protocol independent\n    connectivity interface.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage\n\n    Test automation for WSO2 ESB\n    July 2012 – August 2012\n\n    This was a hackathon carried out to automate the integration tests of WSO2 ESB and expand its test coverage.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage,\n            Hasintha Indrajee,\n            Harsha Kumara,\n            Andun S.L.

Goal of\n    the project is to implement an email repository connector, which have the ability\n    to connect to an email server and crawl the content.\n\n    Team members:\n            Tishan Dahanayakage\n\n    Tanks - Game Client\n    May 2011 – December 2011\n\n    “Tanks” is an arcade game.
