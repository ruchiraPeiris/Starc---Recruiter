This increases the isolation of hearing impaired people. This paper presents a system prototype that is able to automatically recognize sign language to help normal people to communicate more effectively with the hearing or speech impaired people. The Sign to Voice system prototype was developed using Feed Forward Neural Network and the gesture input device was a designed sensor glove. This system recognizes both static and dynamic gestures of American Sign Language including the alphabet and a subset of its words, phrases and sentences. Recognized gestures are translated into voice in real time and the voice input is modeled using a 3D model for the recognition of the signer.\n\nOther creators\nmanoj ratnayake Hiranya Nuwan Kumara Malithi Edirisinghe\nSee project Wireless Sign Language InterepreterSee project"

While her forte was in backend development using PHP, given the current situation at the time, Saumini was required to also make fixes and adjustment on the front-end due to some last minute client changes. She on her own initiative learned up both html and CSS, and helped deliver the final product on time. Saumini has also shown much interest in learning new frameworks and platform. She is definitely a positive addition to any development team and I look forward to be able to work with her again in the future.\nI had the pleasure of working with Saumini for over 3 years during our tenure at Vocanic. Saumini is a quick learner and an extremely smart engineer. I found her to be very dependable and a real asset to the team. I'd gladly work with Saumini again in the future!\nSaumini was one the most dependable engineers I have hired or managed. She is extremely good at analytical thinking and being able to troubleshoot tough problems to resolutions. Combined with a capability to deliver projects from scratch to a timeline, Saumini becomes an extremely valuable member of any engineering team. Saumini started at Vocanic delivering custom built apps for clients, after which she worked on VSocial product line, both on frontend and backend. She also briefly owned Mantle, the underlying API layer for VSocial delivering key milestones. Given an opportunity, I'd be glad to work with her again."}

Simply a customer can link his/her credit card to his/her phone, so that customer can send an USSD request to activate the card from his mobile phone, before purchasing and that activation will be last for several minutes (5 minutes). After that period of time card goes to deactivated mode and no transactions can be done without activating the card again.\n\nIt is a big issue that any third party person can use any ones credit/debit card very easily without any authentication (eg: at super markets, fuel stations...). So this project ensures the security of Credit/Debit cards.\n\nThis project was done for the TadHack 2015"}

After that period of time card goes to deactivated mode and no transactions can be done without activating the card again.\n\nIt is a big issue that any third party person can use any ones credit/debit card very easily without any authentication (eg: at super markets, fuel stations...). So this project ensures the security of Credit/Debit cards.\n\nThis project was done for the TadHack 2015\n\nOther creators\nIsuru Abeywardana Tharindu Lakshitha  \nProject nameGPA HUB\nMar 2015\n\nProject descriptionAvailable on Google Play - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.omalperera.thegpahub\n\n\nGPA HUB is an highly customizable Android app Project, that assist University students to calculate and manage their GPA values.\nGPA HUB app has mainly 2 sections, one is to calculate the GPA very quickly manner.

But in the end due to the factors like the cost, manpower, and the limited time authority decided that we should try and develop the base which is needed to the success of this project. Since the preliminary analysis revealed that the project required a detailed analysis by the experts of soil and the environmental conditions, it has been decided to develop the basic requirement upon which the project can be expanded on a later stage. There included the development of walkways, study center, designs the entrance and information boards.\nSo at the end our task was to develop a study center, which will be used by the students, experts, photographers etc.\n\nOther creators\nPadmasankha Gurusinghe Lahiru Amaratunga Santhuka De Silva Hasith Ranasinghe Hasitha Jayasekara Damitha Nilanka Wijeratne\nSee project Kolonnawa Wetland DevelopmentSee project\nProject nameMunicipal Council Online tender manager - ( Web site - First year Project )\nMar 2012\n\nProject description* Shows Information about municipal council.\n* Users can apply tenders online \n* Admin can see applicants and tender details"}

We developed a proprietary, patent pending weight management system that receives weight measurements from Wi-Fi scales, allowing us to translate individual’s natural weight fluctuation into a trend. Our interface uses a speedometer type gauge (Change-o-meter™) that anticipates weight trend changes two weeks in advance helping our users understand and control their weight. Because our scales do not display weight readout numbers and we treat weight as a trend, our solution is proving to reduce people’s frustration with scales, which in turn makes self-weighing a more motivational and effective process: more people will achieve more sustainable weight loss. \n\nTech stack: CakePHP 2x, MySQL, Bootstrap, Jquery, Android, Objective C, REST API, High ChartsiBooking | www.ibooking.lk\nSep 2017 – Mar 2018\n\nProject descriptioniBooking.lk is a travel fare aggregator website and travel metasearch engine for lodging reservations of Sri Lanka origin. it has been owned and operated by Sri Lanka-based Booking Holdings.\n\nTech stack - CakePHP 2x, MySQLGigstr\nMar 2016 – Jun 2017\n\nProject descriptionGigstr offers a new way of working; work from time to time, all the time, or every other day.

We developed a proprietary, patent pending weight management system that receives weight measurements from Wi-Fi scales, allowing us to translate individual’s natural weight fluctuation into a trend. Our interface uses a speedometer type gauge (Change-o-meter™) that anticipates weight trend changes two weeks in advance helping our users understand and control their weight. Because our scales do not display weight readout numbers and we treat weight as a trend, our solution is proving to reduce people’s frustration with scales, which in turn makes self-weighing a more motivational and effective process: more people will achieve more sustainable weight loss. \n\nTech stack: CakePHP 2x, MySQL, Bootstrap, Jquery, Android, Objective C, REST API, High Charts\n\nOther creators\nPraveen De Silva Renato Romani MD MBA\nSee project Easy way to HealthSee project\nProject nameiBooking | www.ibooking.lk\nSep 2017 – Mar 2018\n\nProject descriptioniBooking.lk is a travel fare aggregator website and travel metasearch engine for lodging reservations of Sri Lanka origin. it has been owned and operated by Sri Lanka-based Booking Holdings.\n\nTech stack - CakePHP 2x, MySQL\n\nOther creators\nShashintha Senanayake Lasitha Dayarathna\nSee project iBooking | www.ibooking.lkSee project\nProject nameGigstr\nMar 2016 – Jun 2017\n\nProject descriptionGigstr offers a new way of working; work from time to time, all the time, or every other day.

He always gives freedom to try something new and encourage us to come up with innovative solutions and new technologies. He has tremendous ability to adapt to any kind of situation and come up with best possible solutions. So I have no doubt he will continue to be a great leader and inspire so many people. I wish him very all the best. \nSajeetharan is a person which has a lot of potential to learn new things and develop. I worked with him nearly 5 years. During this period I have seen many things that we completed both together. The experience was an amazing. A special thing about him is that he never says, cannot or no. He will find a solution anyhow. He is a great person to work with at any given time. I recommend him for anybody for what he is today :) \nSajee is great Friend and also a good colleague. He is a very talented individual with great skill sets. As a full-stack developer he managed to develop and manage a product Digin. He managed the team very well and also made a good product with less number of software engineers, He is a Agile person to work with and hope to see him go up the ladder and bring more product to the market.\n \n All the best Sajee\nSajeetharan is an energetic young team member I came across recently in implementing an BI application system. Sajeetharan took up the challenge of leading the development team after a while and performed the duties beyond our normal expectations. He's discipline in following the principles of development procedures and concepts is very admirable. He has great potential and request him to keep performing at the same level.\nIt's rare that you get a chance to work with a person who is highly motivated and committed to what he does like Sajeetharan. I have the pleasure working with him collaborating with several projects. His ability to handle even the toughest clients and urgent situations is impressive. I'm sure Sajeetharan would be an asset to any team.\nSajeetharan is a creative and hardworking person with outgoing personality. Saji and I worked for the same project at Virtusa, which he successfully achieved some of the major challenges in our project. He has the potentiality to learn latest technologies within a short time and apply to software development. He knows how to maintain the work-life balance and a good team player who encouraged others to succeed. \n \n He is a passionate music lover and an artistic person. Very energetic and a charming person.\n \n He will be good knowledge source to the company he works for. I wish him good luck for future!\nSajee is really a good person to hang with, Very flexible guy to work, One of the best I found in documenting projects, I would like to work with him again."}

This module is significant because in real world it has to be dealt with erroneous data.\nIncremental patient matching is a method of identifying duplicate patients very efficiently. \nIn a real world scenario, the requirement would be to match thousands of patients with each other. Once this matching process continues it would be very time consuming since all of the patients are compared with each of them regardless of the fact that two or three new patients are added/updated.\n\nThis was my GSoC project where I had to bring a mechanism to match patients incrementally and I did complete it successfully.\n\nSee project Patient Matching 2.0 - Incremental Patient MatchingSee project\nProject nameDECD\nMar 2016 – Dec 2016\n\nProject descriptionThis is a software system that is being developed to Dedicated Economic Centre located in Dambulla, Central province, Sri Lanka.

Computational complexity of this algorithm is minimal compared to most of\nthe existing algorithms for tracking objects. Hence the system is able to track the objects\naccurately and efficiently.\n\nThis is a marker less approach; therefore the main drawback of the prevailing systems is addressed. A video feed taken from a single camera is used to provide relevant\nstatistics and a 3D reconstruction of the game. Creation of a 3D reconstruction (\"Hawk\nEye\") using a single video feed is an integral part of this project. A novel algorithm developed to enable this feature and the algorithm also addresses the theoretical problem of perceiving depth using a single viewpoint. This project proposes a method to accurately calculate the 3D location of the ball using a single video feed and details about the standard tennis court in unison. Furthermore\nthe approach used in the project can be extended to analyze other sports which involve standard courts.\n\nOther creators\nRajith Roshan Chamika Nugegoda Lilantha Nawagamuwa\nSee project Sports Analysis Using Video TrackingSee project\nProject nameSri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad 2013\nMar 2013\n\nProject descriptionSri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad is held annually with the hope of discovering mathematical talent in the country, nurturing them and sending a team to the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).\n\nOther creators\nMaleen Abeydeera Kasun Fernando    Kirshanthan Sundararajah \nSee project Sri Lankan Mathematical Olympiad 2013See project\nProject nameGrid solving Automatic Robot\n2011\n\nProject descriptionCapable of transporting the blocks.\nCapable of search the grid and find out the position of the cauldron."}

The young owner of the Salon Shani, Mrs. Erandi is the client to this\nproject. The website will enhance and help to promote Mrs. Erandi’s business by providing a\nway to publish her good work and get more customers through the website.Web based system for audio monitoring\nJan 2014\n\nProject descriptionThe purpose of the project is to assist the relevant authorities to enforce the Intellectual Property Act of Sri Lanka. The system would monitor all the radio stations in Sri Lanka and provide a report consisting of the songs played by the radio station, which would allow OSCA ( Outstanding Song Creators' Association - The Client ) to send the radio stations invoices and charge them for the songs played thereby provide the flow of royalties to the copyright holders of the songs. We were provided with the song identification algorithm and we developed a web based solution connecting it to our system which facilitates storing all the details and viewing reports at the end of a certain period of time."

The project was agile, hence constant communication with Yasas throughout the project from planning to daily scrums.\n \n Yasas is a very talented and hard working young man with a lot of potential. Yasas is very innovative and always looking for new solutions and fresh ideas that can advance his knowledge to exceed expectations and goals. He is passionate about his work and always seems to have great awareness of new creative strategies and technology.\n \n Yasas is dedicated, enthusiastic, intelligent, and responsible.\n \n The project was a complicated and complexed new technology initiative that required a lot of attention / effort, learning and team work. Yasas's dedication & contribution to this initiative set us up well to make the project a success.\n \n Edmund Sanjeev\n Systems Analyst/ Product Owner \n Icon Global\n Edmund.sanjeev@iconglobal.com.au\\nYasas is a highly-motivated, focused and talented individual who always looking for new challenges. We worked together in 99X Technology on a project which delivered single page web application as a modernization of a legacy healthcare management system. Yasas did a wonderful job in this project by automating the delivery chain using cloud infrastructure of AWS with a modern toolchain and best practices. This greatly increased developer productivity and shortened the development cycle.Ability to taking the ownership of what he get assigned is the rare quality I see in Yasas. Moreover, he got great analytical, programming and presentation skills. I undoubtedly recommend him for any future endeavor which these qualities matter.\nYasas was an excellent intern I worked with very recently. He is magically super fast in grabbing knowledge and being a master of it. He is extremely good at explaining what he knows to the other team members very clearly. He is ultra dependable and you don't need to have any worries about the tasks you give to him. His attitude towards work is extremely great. He is always result driven. I highly recommend him for any project. \nI have had the pleasure of working with Yasas in my capacity as a volunteer and the Programme Director of SL2College. Yasas initially joined SL2College as a Speaker at SL Inspire School Seminars. Given his impressive work ethic and dedication to the team, I asked him to take up the position of Assistant Programme Manager in the seminar team, where he was responsible for organising and coordinating the ground level activities of numerous seminars. One of the many challenges when working with volunteers is the lack of accountability. Yasas is one of the few individuals with whom this is not an issue. When he takes on a responsibility we have complete faith that he would deliver. Furthermore, he is a great public speaker and I have personally witnessed him inspiring hundreds of young school students to pursue higher education."}
