The aim of Redbox is to provide an elegantly orchestrated and simply connected F&ID business to our Clients. Redbox's vision is to be both a single client portal and smart platform that can coordinate Fraud and ID products across the Experian suite and provide end-to-end client solutions.\nThis elegance and coordination will not come quickly or easily, which is why the Redbox project is split into two phases. The first phase will run through May 2016 and deliver a minimum viable product with a single client access point.\nOther creator\nIroshana Ambalakande Gedara\nSee project RedBoxSee project\nProject nameAdTruth Resolver\nJul 2014\n\nProject descriptionMarketers are inefficient in their ad spend since they are not able to reliably target individuals due to web access channels (e.g. multiple browsers, native apps) and device proliferation. These inefficiencies can be due to factors such as poor conversion analytics, too broadly targeted media or not reaching a customer during their decision journey. \nZander is creating an id for each device and household that can be reliably targeted and analyzed when only anonymous data is present. In addition, Zander will support client supplied attributes such as one way hashed identifiers that are representative of PII. Zander is using all available ids as inputs to create the device level ID. \n\nTechnologies: Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, NoSQL (Aerospike), Amazon Web Services, RabbitMQ, DropWizard, JUnit\n\nOther creators\nAsanka Umesh Iroshana Ambalakande Gedara\nProject nameIron Mountain\nApr 2012"}

It can be either a printed document or even a hand written one. Thereafter the image will be stored into the Amazon's S3 cloud storage, from where the \"Optical Character Recognition\" is being used to convert those tables into charts which could be an interactive way of analyzing. Finally the user will be able to download those charts as an image, as a pdf and so on. So this application basically allows the users to convert tables into charts.\nOther creators\nKulasangar Gowrisangar Sithum Jayawardena Maurakirinathan Paramalingam Ravindu Abayawardena\nProject nameBrandix: Warehouse Management System\nJul 2013\n\nProject descriptionFully fledged Warehouse Management System implementation for Brandix"}

It's a common logic that any relationships which are represented in tables can be also represented as Nodes and Edges that is graph representation. Both the model (Relational Model and Graph Model) based on the common feature of relationships. This project when gets stabled will be contributed to Postgresql developer group and Rogas project where the initial idea was evolved\n\nSee project HeftSee project\nProject nameA Javascript Visualizer and Analyzer\nJan 2014 – Jan 2016\n\nProject descriptionWebsite development is one of the most prominent development areas in software development industry. Developing and maintaining a web site is a difficult task due to the increasing complexity of web site development. The most popular programming language is JavaScript. It is highly dynamic and weakly typed language. Therefore, development tools which are currently available for JavaScript still haven’t reached a level on which the developers can rely on. The main reason for this is that JavaScript frameworks are being developed faster with different architectures and therefore, JavaScript helper tools can become obsolete as soon as new frameworks are introduced.\n\nThere are helper tools available which would analyze a given JavaScript file or generate a call graph for a JavaScript file or generate a dependency graph for a given web site project. However, some of them are no longer supported and most of them depend on other libraries like JavaScript parsers and therefore, those dependencies are needed to run them, which can be a usability problem. Furthermore, none of the previous work or currently available tools were able to generate a call graph dynamically while the website was running, which would immensely facilitate in debugging the web site.\n\nProject nameLie Detector\nApr 2015\n\nProject descriptionA research project to create a framework which could provide functionalities for state securities in their crime investigations to identify criminals from suspects.\n\nProject nameWatch Your Six - Cutting Edge 2013\nMay 2013\n\nProject descriptionA low cost reversing system using ultra sonic motion sensor and Arduino Uno controller.\nOther creators\nMinoli Perera Prathieshna Vekneswaran\nProject nameE-Logic(Robotic arm to help paralyzed patients\nProject descriptionA robot hand which enables the patient to wear it as a glove and give exercise to their arms by giving the minimal support and making it automated. Basically, it will provide exercise to the wrist and elbows to flexion and extension and also joints of the fingers as well as to rotate the thumb. Most importantly it will enable the user (doctor) to insert the number of rotations needed for a particular joint and it will give a positive mentality for the patient to feel he or she is receiving treatment from someone, while being very user friendly."}

I highly recommend Chinthaka as a must need key player in a software development team.\nChinthaka is currently working in my banking project and he is a fantastic person to work with. He is hard working and very serious about the deliveries. Chinthaka never refuses you when you ask him for help. Also he can focus on many tasks at once.\nChinthaka was a young Java developer when he was joining with the company. But he was running closer to the senior developers, because of his talent and great personality to work closely with the team. Chinthak is very much eager to learn new techs. He was definitely good value for the company. I wish him very best of luck on his future carrier achievements.\nI have worked on multiple projects with Chinthaka and I find him to be an extremely technical developer. He is very creative and has excellent problem solving skills. He has a great picture and overview of what needs to be accomplished and his design and development for our Java products have been successfully launched because of Chinthaka‘s outstanding accomplishments. Chinthaka works great with his peers and core feature team members and he always had a great working relationship with me and my team. Chinthaka is a huge asset to our team and our organizations success.\nI had a pleasure to work for about 2 years with Chinthaka at the same time and was impressed with the depth of knowledge he possesses. Chinthaka did an exceptional job on the recent project. Chinthaka is a goal oriented, intelligent, responsible and reliable perfectionist. Highly motivated, precise, well educated and creative project manager. Works towards maximal customer satisfaction. Makes the impossible possible\nChinthaka was one of the most dedicated professionals through his work at Sajeewi Soft Solution. Creative natural born leader. Deadline oriented colleague with deep and practical knowledge of software methodologies. I enjoyed working with him on the various projects we took on. It's amazing to work with such a person.\nChinthaka was the first Java developer who came for the interview with a software developed by himself in a compact disk, ready to install and run. He impressed us with this for the first time. Then he started delivering his maximum at every problem he got to solve while playing really well in the team. He is hard working and best at solving complex issues. If I have to describe him in single word, I'd say \"talented\". \nChinthaka is a hard worker and creative problem solver, highly passionate about software development, and always keen to learn more and develop knowledge. Glad to be part of a team, he appreciates an atmosphere of creative and intellectual freedom while focusing on delivering the needs of the client to the tee."}

The system uses the rule based and statistical machine translation techniques. The system is capable of on demand web page translation and it is capable of identifying subject object and verb phrase of a sentence for translation and even it is capable of deciding the form of a word (Inanimate, Masculine or Feminine) and it is transliterating names and places to make more accurate translation. And also the System is capable of handling the language ambiguity to get the more accurate Sinhala translation.CenterPEDE\nApr 2013 – Oct 2013\n\nProject descriptionCenterPEDE (cen·ter·pead) is the performance testing tool developed at Virtusa bringing together the best of the open source and commercial worlds.\n\nCenterPEDE was developed under the following objectives:\n\nAlign and integrate the phases of the performance testing life-cycle.\n\nIncrease the user-friendliness and accelerate the performance testing activities.\n\nNurturing from the robustness of JMeter for web based application performance testing.\n\nProvide comprehensive detailed performance testing results for easier reliable analysis.\n\nLimit the burden on the tool during test execution, to ensure it does not skew the results of the AUT falsely.Online CV System\nAug 2011 – Jul 2012\n\nProject descriptionIn this online CV system we provide facilities to undergraduates to maintain their own profile while they are studying in the university. They can include their details in their own profile and specially their academic qualifications. These unique profiles must be updated daily by either undergraduates or the universities .We ensures that only these two parties can update the profiles. As an example, when a student finishes his/her level -2 in the university, the relevant department or the faculty has the authority to update the profile mentioning the course modules and the grades, that student have obtained. If a student follows an external course they can update their own profiles with that information but they have to prove it by including references. The most important fact is that the system provides the facility to employer companies to know whether the profile is updated by the student or the university. \nWhen the students leave the university after their graduation they have a complete profile with every necessary details. As a result of that employer companies who are willing to work with fresh and young employees can easily get the information regarding the available CV s on the system .The system has the advantage of finding the employees with qualifications by a filtering system. As an example, a company wants to have a new employee who is capable of web developing, programming with 2-year experience in industry. The company only has to enter these qualifications and submit it on to the system. It immediately gives the list of employees who have those qualifications. And by pressing a one single button they can get the printed CV of that employee.Ultimate Transport System for Buses\nFeb 2012 – Mar 2012\n\nProject descriptionAs everyone knows well, there can't be seen a proper time scheduled transportation system in Sri Lanka. Still many people meet with huge difficulties when they want to find the time tables of those systems.
