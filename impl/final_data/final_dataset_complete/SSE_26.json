Through this research project we tested the hypothesis that learning strong feature representations of images can enhance the semantic understanding of images by machines. Through this project a novel recursive hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed to detect the local optima of the number of clusters of a dataset. A hierarchical clustering approach for clustering images into semantically meaningful mixture types based on a recursive hierarchical clustering algorithm prioritizing the most important features from a high dimensional dataset is developed. Secondly a Convolution Neural Network model to extract the visual patterns with regard to attribute mixture types of the images using deep learning schema by training deep representations of the semantically meaningful attribute mixture types is developed. Thirdly a natural language processing module which decrypts the visual patterns from the Convolution Neural Network module to semantically meaningful natural language representations and the querying by open language text has been developed. An integrated system capable of automatic annotating of images using natural language considering the semantic meaning of images is developed by integrating the above mentioned core modules. Furthermore image querying using natural language queries has also been achieved by the system.\n\nTechnologies and tools- Python, MATLAB, Caffe, Tensorflow, Elastic Search, NLTK dependency parser\n\nOther creators\nPavani De Silva Damith Dilshan\nSee project Attribute Based Image Querying SystemSee project\nProject nameReferral Marketing Platform for EduLink Campus\nAug 2015 – Nov 2015\n\nProject descriptionA web based platform to use referral programs to offer current customers incentives to promote company's brand, products, and services.\n\nTechnologies – Angular JS, Nodejs, MongoDB\nOther creator\nDamith Dilshan\nProject nameHospital Management System\nJul 2014 – May 2015\n\nProject descriptionSecond year industry based project done for Winsetha Hospital and was mentored by Pyxle (Pvt) Ltd.

This is a portable device that can be used to mark multiple choice exam papers more accurately and quickly than the currently available methods. Each student is given a device where they will input their answers and at the end of the given time the answers are transferred to the invigilators computer and automatically marked there.

During the morning commute there is additional stress because delays caused by traffic can make people late for work. Therefore lack of information about current traffic condition has caused lot of problems in day to life of people.\n\nAs a solution for the above mentioned problems this report refers to a development of a mobile application and a website which can be used to get the reliable traffic data in certain areas. The main source of data is GPS data received form the smart phone. From those it would be possible to identify the location and the moving speed of the vehicle. Therefore the users of this application have to log in to the application in their smartphones that displays crowd sourced data about traffic flows in the area whenever they travel. GPS data will be analyzed via CEP. After analyzing the data accordingly then they are displayed on a map in the android smart phone as well as on a website.\n\ntechnologies used : - - Android Mobile Application ,\n-Webservices \n-java\n-MySql , Siddhi ( a type of Query used to analyze data in Complex event Processor , wso2)Language \n\nProject Supervisor : Mr.Srinath Perera (Vice President, Research at WSO2 Inc.)\nProject Supervisor :Dr .

PSE also includes a payment engine capable of abstracting the payment engine capable of abstracting the payment lifecycle while integrating with multiple payment gateways, including: telco-billing systems, PayPal, and stored-value accounts.\nTechnologies: Java EE, Spring, Hibernate, JSF,Ant, Web Services,liquibase, Oracle.Hybrid Machine Translation tool for English to Sinhala machine translation\nJan 2014 – Dec 2014\n\nProject descriptionAim of this project is to help people with low English knowledge. The system uses the rule based and statistical machine translation techniques. The system is capable of on demand web page translation and it is capable of identifying subject object and verb phrase of a sentence for translation and even it is capable of deciding the form of a word (Inanimate, Masculine or Feminine) and it is transliterating names and places to make more accurate translation. And also the System is capable of handling the language ambiguity to get the more accurate Sinhala translation.CenterPEDE\nApr 2013 – Oct 2013\n\nProject descriptionCenterPEDE (cen·ter·pead) is the performance testing tool developed at Virtusa bringing together the best of the open source and commercial worlds.\n\nCenterPEDE was developed under the following objectives:\n\nAlign and integrate the phases of the performance testing life-cycle.\n\nIncrease the user-friendliness and accelerate the performance testing activities.\n\nNurturing from the robustness of JMeter for web based application performance testing.\n\nProvide comprehensive detailed performance testing results for easier reliable analysis.\n\nLimit the burden on the tool during test execution, to ensure it does not skew the results of the AUT falsely.Online CV System\nAug 2011 – Jul 2012\n\nProject descriptionIn this online CV system we provide facilities to undergraduates to maintain their own profile while they are studying in the university. They can include their details in their own profile and specially their academic qualifications. These unique profiles must be updated daily by either undergraduates or the universities .We ensures that only these two parties can update the profiles. As an example, when a student finishes his/her level -2 in the university, the relevant department or the faculty has the authority to update the profile mentioning the course modules and the grades, that student have obtained. If a student follows an external course they can update their own profiles with that information but they have to prove it by including references. The most important fact is that the system provides the facility to employer companies to know whether the profile is updated by the student or the university. \nWhen the students leave the university after their graduation they have a complete profile with every necessary details. As a result of that employer companies who are willing to work with fresh and young employees can easily get the information regarding the available CV s on the system .The system has the advantage of finding the employees with qualifications by a filtering system. As an example, a company wants to have a new employee who is capable of web developing, programming with 2-year experience in industry. The company only has to enter these qualifications and submit it on to the system. It immediately gives the list of employees who have those qualifications. And by pressing a one single button they can get the printed CV of that employee.Ultimate Transport System for Buses\nFeb 2012 – Mar 2012\n\nProject descriptionAs everyone knows well, there can't be seen a proper time scheduled transportation system in Sri Lanka. Still many people meet with huge difficulties when they want to find the time tables of those systems. So we came up with a solution for that and we implemented this product in the Colombo Hackathon - The first ever hackathon in Sri Lanka. Simply we use a mobile application and we use Android mobile development and USSD technologies in the mobile application. Main server is run in java Tomcat server. We plan to introduce this product to customers near future through the help of Etiselat mobile partners in Sri Lanka.Automated Message System for Education institutes\nAug 2010 – Jul 2011\n\nProject descriptionThe aim of this project is to develop an Automatic messaging system for students and academic staff members of Universities and Institutes to send and receive academic information through the SMS technology among them and develop a database to store the student’s information. This system will work as a bridge between students and members of the academic staff."
