Database I have used is MySQLMaster Data Project - MAS Holdings\nJan 2016 – Aug 2016\n\nProject descriptionMaster data application is a .net project which act as an interface between SAP and User. Due to lack of functionalities and facilities provided by SAP, Master data project was created.\nThe main task of the application was creating and maintaining the data in SAP. As an example SAP contained data regarding products which MAS create, material they used, customers and vendors of the company and etc. Master data project contained sub projects like customer master and vendor master. Vendor master was done by me. There were several roles of users in the application like requester, 1st approver, 2nd approver and super user. When requester create a data set it should be approved by 1st approver and 2nd approver before sending them to SAP. Until it is send to SAP data were saved in SQL server. Each user is informed by email with relevant link.\nThis is a .net web application which used layered architecture (Client layer, WCF Service layer, Business logic layer and data access layer). Front-end development was done with angularjs because it provide much more functionalities for creating interface, validation and etc. client application layer contained with html files, JavaScript files, angular service and c# controllers. Business logic layer was accessed through WCF service layer. Entity framework and stored procedure were used in Data access layer to work with SQL server. Repository pattern with Generic classes was used for executing functions with database."
