I was able to maintain an outstanding academic record in balance with extra-curricular activities, where I was able to actively participate in several clubs, societies. \n I was able to get great experience and corporate exposure through the global internship program of AIESEC. And was also able to provide community service through the Rotaract club.\n Sports has always been my thing, where I was able to secure a spot in the interschool aquatic club as a distinguished swimmer representing my alma mater. I also played basketball at the university level.\nApart from the work, I would like to spend my spare time by listening to music, playing guitar, traveling, visiting untouched beauty spots around the country. Outdoor adventures like rock climbing, hiking and rafting have always been my all-time favorites.",

Being one of the trio behind the 'change' of the magazine from 2015, the responsibility in simple words was to carry forward the good work and improve the magazine continously in what ever the way possible. Having tabled a vision for the magazine at it's revamp - 'Continuously improve in quality and content', 2017 edition of the magazine reached that vision far beyond the expectation, having gathered many volunteers with quality content and doubling the content from last year. This was quite a mile stone for the magazine as many features, which were not able to include in the previous were included and provided excessive space to portrait the immense talent of the students in the faculty in all aspects. \nAlthough, it was great pleasure working with the biggest crew yet for the magazine and it would have not been possible without this team effort."
